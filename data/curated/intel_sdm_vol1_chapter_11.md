## PROGRAMMING WITH INTEL® STREAMING SIMD EXTENSIONS 2 (INTEL® SSE2)

---

The streaming SIMD extensions 2 (SSE2) were introduced into the IA-32 architecture in the Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors. These extensions enhance the performance of IA-32 processors for advanced 3-D graphics, video decoding/encoding, speech recognition, E-commerce, Internet, scientific, and engineering applications.

This chapter describes the SSE2 extensions and provides information to assist in writing application programs that use these and the SSE extensions.

### 11.1 OVERVIEW OF INTEL® SSE2

Intel SSE2 uses the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) execution model that is used with MMX technology and Intel SSE. They extend this model with support for packed double precision floating-point values and for 128-bit packed integers.

If `CPUID.01H:EDX.SSE2[26] = 1`, Intel SSE2 is present.

Intel SSE2 adds the following features to the IA-32 architecture, while maintaining backward compatibility with all existing IA-32 processors, applications, and operating systems.

- Six data types:
  - 128-bit packed double precision floating-point (two IEEE Standard 754 double precision floating-point values packed into a double quadword).
  - 128-bit packed byte integers.
  - 128-bit packed word integers.
  - 128-bit packed doubleword integers.
  - 128-bit packed quadword integers.
- Instructions to support the additional data types and extend existing SIMD integer operations:
  - Packed and scalar double precision floating-point instructions.
  - Additional 64-bit and 128-bit SIMD integer instructions.
  - 128-bit versions of SIMD integer instructions introduced with the MMX technology and Intel SSE.
  - Additional cacheability-control and instruction-ordering instructions.
- Modifications to existing IA-32 instructions to support Intel SSE2 features:
  - Extensions and modifications to the `CPUID` instruction.
  - Modifications to the `RDPNC` instruction.

These new features extend the IA-32 architecture's SIMD programming model in three important ways:

- They provide the ability to perform SIMD operations on pairs of packed double precision floating-point values. This permits higher precision computations to be carried out in XMM registers, which enhances processor performance in scientific and engineering applications and in applications that use advanced 3-D geometry techniques (such as ray tracing). Additional flexibility is provided with instructions that operate on single (scalar) double precision floating-point values located in the low quadword of an XMM register.
- They provide the ability to operate on 128-bit packed integers (bytes, words, doublewords, and quadwords) in XMM registers. This provides greater flexibility and greater throughput when performing SIMD operations on packed integers. The capability is particularly useful for applications such as RSA authentication and RC5 encryption. Using the full set of SIMD registers, data types, and instructions provided with the MMX technology and Intel SSE/SSE2, programmers can develop algorithms that finely mix packed single- and double precision floating-point data and 64- and 128-bit packed integer data.
- Intel SSE2 enhances the support introduced with Intel SSE for controlling the cacheability of SIMD data. Intel SSE2 cache control instructions provide the ability to stream data in and out of the XMM registers without polluting the caches and the ability to prefetch data before it is actually used.

Intel SSE2 is fully compatible with all software written for IA-32 processors. All existing software continues to run correctly, without modification, on processors that incorporate Intel SSE2, as well as in the presence of applications that incorporate these extensions. Enhancements to the CPUID instruction permit detection of Intel SSE2. Also, because Intel SSE2 uses the same registers as Intel SSE, no new operating-system support is required for saving and restoring program state during a context switch beyond that provided for Intel SSE.

Intel SSE2 is accessible from all IA-32 execution modes: protected mode, real address mode, and virtual 8086 mode.

The following sections in this chapter describe the programming environment for Intel SSE2, including: the 128-bit XMM floating-point register set, data types, and Intel SSE2 instructions. The chapter also describes exceptions that can be generated with the Intel SSE and SSE2 instructions and gives guidelines for writing applications with Intel SSE and SSE2.

For additional information about Intel SSE2, see:

- The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 2A, 2B, 2C, & 2D, provides a detailed description of individual Intel SSE2 instructions.
- Chapter 16, "System Programming for Instruction Set Extensions and Processor Extended States," in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A, gives guidelines for integrating Intel SSE and SSE2 into an operating-system environment.

## 11.2 INTEL® SSE2 PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT

Figure 11-1 shows the programming environment for Intel SSE2. No new registers or other instruction execution state are defined with Intel SSE2. Intel SSE2 instructions use XMM registers, MMX registers, and/or IA-32 general-purpose registers, as follows:

- **XMM registers** — These eight registers (see Figure 10-2) are used to operate on packed or scalar double precision floating-point data. Scalar operations are operations performed on individual (unpacked) double precision floating-point values stored in the low quadword of an XMM register. XMM registers are also used to perform operations on 128-bit packed integer data. They are referenced by the names XMM0 through XMM7.

![Diagram of the Intel SSE2 Execution Environment showing the hierarchy of registers and the address space.](a5f0fee215955903e4d4b2e69bebb0f3_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the execution environment for Intel SSE2. It features a large rectangular frame containing several components:

- XMM Registers:** A box labeled "XMM Registers Eight 128-Bit" is positioned at the top left.
- MXCSR Register:** A box labeled "MXCSR Register 32 Bits" is located below the XMM registers.
- MMX Registers:** A box labeled "MMX Registers Eight 64-Bit" is positioned below the MXCSR register.
- General-Purpose Registers:** A box labeled "General-Purpose Registers Eight 32-Bit" is positioned below the MMX registers.
- EFLAGS Register:** A box labeled "EFLAGS Register 32 Bits" is located at the bottom left.
- Address Space:** A vertical bar on the right side is labeled "Address Space" at the top. It has a "2<sup>32</sup> - 1" label at the top and a "0" label at the bottom, indicating the range of the address space.

Figure 11-1. Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 Execution Environment

- **MXCSR register** — This 32-bit register (see Figure 10-3) provides status and control bits used in floating-point operations. The denormals-are-zeros and flush-to-zero flags in this register provide a higher performance alternative for the handling of denormal source operands and denormal (underflow) results. For more

information on the functions of these flags see Section 10.2.3.4, “Denormals-Are-Zeros,” and Section 10.2.3.3, “Flush-To-Zero.”

- **MMX registers** — These eight registers (see Figure 9-2) are used to perform operations on 64-bit packed integer data. They are also used to hold operands for some operations performed between MMX and XMM registers. MMX registers are referenced by the names MM0 through MM7.
- **General-purpose registers** — The eight general-purpose registers (see Figure 3-5) are used along with the existing IA-32 addressing modes to address operands in memory. MMX and XMM registers cannot be used to address memory. The general-purpose registers are also used to hold operands for some SSE2 instructions. These registers are referenced by the names EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI, and ESP.
- **EFLAGS register** — This 32-bit register (see Figure 3-8) is used to record the results of some compare operations.

### 11.2.1 Intel® SSE2 in 64-Bit Mode and Compatibility Mode

In compatibility mode, Intel SSE2 functions like it does in protected mode. In 64-bit mode, eight additional XMM registers are accessible. Registers XMM8-XMM15 are accessed by using REX prefixes.

Memory operands are specified using the ModR/M, SIB encoding described in Section 3.7.5.

Some Intel SSE2 instructions may be used to operate on general-purpose registers. Use the REX.W prefix to access 64-bit general-purpose registers. Note that if a REX prefix is used when it has no meaning, the prefix is ignored.

### 11.2.2 Compatibility of Intel® SSE2 with Intel® SSE, MMX Technology, and x87 FPU Programming Environment

Intel SSE2 does not introduce any new state to the IA-32 execution environment beyond that of Intel SSE. Intel SSE2 represents an enhancement of Intel SSE; they are fully compatible and share the same state information. Intel SSE and SSE2 instructions can be executed together in the same instruction stream without the need to save state when switching between instruction sets.

XMM registers are independent of the x87 FPU and MMX registers; so Intel SSE and SSE2 operations performed on XMM registers can be performed in parallel with x87 FPU or MMX technology operations; see Section 11.6.7, “Interaction of Intel® SSE and SSE2 Instructions with x87 FPU and MMX Instructions.”

The FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions save and restore the SSE and SSE2 states along with the x87 FPU and MMX states.

### 11.2.3 Denormals-Are-Zeros Flag

The denormals-are-zeros flag (bit 6 in the MXCSR register) was introduced into the IA-32 architecture with Intel SSE2. See Section 10.2.3.4, “Denormals-Are-Zeros,” for a description of this flag.

## 11.3 INTEL® SSE2 DATA TYPES

Intel SSE2 introduced one 128-bit packed floating-point data type and four 128-bit SIMD integer data types to the IA-32 architecture (see Figure 11-2).

- **Packed double precision floating-point** — This 128-bit data type consists of two IEEE 64-bit double precision floating-point values packed into a double quadword. See Figure 4-3 for the layout of a 64-bit double precision floating-point value; refer to Section 4.2.2, “Floating-Point Data Types,” for a detailed description of double precision floating-point values.
- **128-bit packed integers** — The four 128-bit packed integer data types can contain 16 byte integers, 8 word integers, 4 doubleword integers, or 2 quadword integers. Refer to Section 4.6.2, “128-Bit Packed SIMD Data Types,” for a detailed description of the 128-bit packed integers.

![Figure 11-2: Data Types Introduced with Intel® SSE2. The diagram shows five horizontal bars representing 128-bit data types. 1. 128-Bit Packed Double-Precision Floating-Point: A single bar from bit 127 to 0. 2. 128-Bit Packed Byte Integers: A bar divided into 16 segments of 8 bits each, from bit 127 to 0. 3. 128-Bit Packed Word Integers: A bar divided into 8 segments of 16 bits each, from bit 127 to 0. 4. 128-Bit Packed Doubleword Integers: A bar divided into 4 segments of 32 bits each, from bit 127 to 0. 5. 128-Bit Packed Quadword Integers: A bar divided into 2 segments of 64 bits each, from bit 127 to 0.](eb8cac9fb65d601ab50405472e408156_img.jpg)

**Figure 11-2. Data Types Introduced with Intel® SSE2**

All of these data types are operated on in XMM registers or memory. Instructions are provided to convert between these 128-bit data types and the 64-bit and 32-bit data types.

The address of a 128-bit packed memory operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary, except in the following cases:

- A MOVUPD instruction that supports unaligned accesses.
- Scalar instructions that use an 8-byte memory operand that is not subject to alignment requirements.

Figure 4-2 shows the byte order of 128-bit (double quadword) and 64-bit (quadword) data types in memory.

## 11.4 INTEL® SSE2 INSTRUCTIONS

The Intel SSE2 instructions are divided into four functional groups:

- Packed and scalar double precision floating-point instructions.
- 64-bit and 128-bit SIMD integer instructions.
- 128-bit extensions of SIMD integer instructions introduced with the MMX technology and Intel SSE.
- Cacheability-control and instruction-ordering instructions.

The following sections provide more information about each group.

### 11.4.1 Packed and Scalar Double Precision Floating-Point Instructions

The packed and scalar double precision floating-point instructions are divided into the following sub-groups:

- Data movement instructions.
- Arithmetic instructions.
- Comparison instructions.
- Conversion instructions.
- Logical instructions.
- Shuffle instructions.

The packed double precision floating-point instructions perform SIMD operations similarly to the packed single precision floating-point instructions (see Figure 11-3). Each source operand contains two double precision floating-

point values, and the destination operand contains the results of the operation (OP) performed in parallel on the corresponding values (X0 and Y0, and X1 and Y1) in each operand.

![Figure 11-3: Packed Double Precision Floating-Point Operations. This diagram illustrates a parallel operation on two 128-bit operands. The first operand is split into two 64-bit halves, X1 (high) and X0 (low). The second operand is split into Y1 (high) and Y0 (low). Arrows show that X1 and Y1 are fed into an operation circle labeled 'OP', and X0 and Y0 are also fed into an 'OP' circle. The results of these operations are then packed back into a 128-bit destination register, with the result of X1 OP Y1 in the high half and the result of X0 OP Y0 in the low half.](33013933550b78b0f07d622a01705b10_img.jpg)

Figure 11-3: Packed Double Precision Floating-Point Operations. This diagram illustrates a parallel operation on two 128-bit operands. The first operand is split into two 64-bit halves, X1 (high) and X0 (low). The second operand is split into Y1 (high) and Y0 (low). Arrows show that X1 and Y1 are fed into an operation circle labeled 'OP', and X0 and Y0 are also fed into an 'OP' circle. The results of these operations are then packed back into a 128-bit destination register, with the result of X1 OP Y1 in the high half and the result of X0 OP Y0 in the low half.

**Figure 11-3. Packed Double Precision Floating-Point Operations**

The scalar double precision floating-point instructions operate on the low (least significant) quadwords of two source operands (X0 and Y0), as shown in Figure 11-4. The high quadword (X1) of the first source operand is passed through to the destination. The scalar operations are similar to the floating-point operations performed in x87 FPU data registers with the precision control field in the x87 FPU control word set for double precision (53-bit significand), except that x87 stack operations use a 15-bit exponent range for the result while Intel SSE2 operations use an 11-bit exponent range.

See Section 11.6.8, “Compatibility of SIMD and x87 FPU Floating-Point Data Types,” for more information about obtaining compatible results when performing both scalar double precision floating-point operations in XMM registers and in x87 FPU data registers.

![Figure 11-4: Scalar Double Precision Floating-Point Operations. This diagram shows a scalar operation where only the low 64-bit halves of two 128-bit operands are used. The first operand has a high half X1 and a low half X0. The second operand has a high half Y1 and a low half Y0. An arrow shows X1 being passed directly to the destination register. Another arrow shows X0 and Y0 being fed into an operation circle labeled 'OP'. The result of X0 OP Y0 is then placed in the low half of the destination register, while the original X1 value remains in the high half.](2c50d5b74f5e276606bab76a8e0c6333_img.jpg)

Figure 11-4: Scalar Double Precision Floating-Point Operations. This diagram shows a scalar operation where only the low 64-bit halves of two 128-bit operands are used. The first operand has a high half X1 and a low half X0. The second operand has a high half Y1 and a low half Y0. An arrow shows X1 being passed directly to the destination register. Another arrow shows X0 and Y0 being fed into an operation circle labeled 'OP'. The result of X0 OP Y0 is then placed in the low half of the destination register, while the original X1 value remains in the high half.

**Figure 11-4. Scalar Double Precision Floating-Point Operations**

### 11.4.1.1 Data Movement Instructions

Data movement instructions move double precision floating-point data between XMM registers and between XMM registers and memory.

The MOVAPD (move aligned packed double precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 128-bit packed double precision floating-point operand from memory to an XMM register or vice versa, or between XMM registers. The memory address must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary; if not, a general-protection exception (GP#) is generated.

The MOVUPD (move unaligned packed double precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 128-bit packed double precision floating-point operand from memory to an XMM register or vice versa, or between XMM registers. Alignment of the memory address is not required.

The MOVSD (move scalar double precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 64-bit double precision floating-point operand from memory to the low quadword of an XMM register or vice versa, or between XMM registers. Alignment of the memory address is not required, unless alignment checking is enabled.

The MOVHPD (move high packed double precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 64-bit double precision floating-point operand from memory to the high quadword of an XMM register or vice versa. The low quadword of the register is left unchanged. Alignment of the memory address is not required, unless alignment checking is enabled.

The MOVLPD (move low packed double precision floating-point) instruction transfers a 64-bit double precision floating-point operand from memory to the low quadword of an XMM register or vice versa. The high quadword of the register is left unchanged. Alignment of the memory address is not required, unless alignment checking is enabled.

The MOVMSKPD (move packed double precision floating-point mask) instruction extracts the sign bit of each of the two packed double precision floating-point numbers in an XMM register and saves them in a general-purpose register. This 2-bit value can then be used as a condition to perform branching.

### 11.4.1.2 Intel® SSE2 Arithmetic Instructions

Intel SSE2 arithmetic instructions perform addition, subtraction, multiply, divide, square root, and maximum/minimum operations on packed and scalar double precision floating-point values.

The ADDPD (add packed double precision floating-point values) and SUBPD (subtract packed double precision floating-point values) instructions add and subtract, respectively, two packed double precision floating-point operands.

The ADDSD (add scalar double precision floating-point values) and SUBSD (subtract scalar double precision floating-point values) instructions add and subtract, respectively, the low double precision floating-point values of two operands and stores the result in the low quadword of the destination operand.

The MULPD (multiply packed double precision floating-point values) instruction multiplies two packed double precision floating-point operands.

The MULSD (multiply scalar double precision floating-point values) instruction multiplies the low double precision floating-point values of two operands and stores the result in the low quadword of the destination operand.

The DIVPD (divide packed double precision floating-point values) instruction divides two packed double precision floating-point operands.

The DIVSD (divide scalar double precision floating-point values) instruction divides the low double precision floating-point values of two operands and stores the result in the low quadword of the destination operand.

The SQRTPD (compute square roots of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction computes the square roots of the values in a packed double precision floating-point operand.

The SQRTSD (compute square root of scalar double precision floating-point values) instruction computes the square root of the low double precision floating-point value in the source operand and stores the result in the low quadword of the destination operand.

The MAXPD (return maximum of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction compares the corresponding values in two packed double precision floating-point operands and returns the numerically greater value from each comparison to the destination operand.

The MAXSD (return maximum of scalar double precision floating-point values) instruction compares the low double precision floating-point values from two packed double precision floating-point operands and returns the numerically higher value from the comparison to the low quadword of the destination operand.

The MINPD (return minimum of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction compares the corresponding values from two packed double precision floating-point operands and returns the numerically lesser value from each comparison to the destination operand.

The **MINSD** (return minimum of scalar double precision floating-point values) instruction compares the low values from two packed double precision floating-point operands and returns the numerically lesser value from the comparison to the low quadword of the destination operand.

### 11.4.1.3 Intel® SSE2 Logical Instructions

Intel SSE2 logical instructions perform AND, AND NOT, OR, and XOR operations on packed double precision floating-point values.

The **ANDPD** (bitwise logical AND of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction returns the logical AND of two packed double precision floating-point operands.

The **ANDNPD** (bitwise logical AND NOT of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction returns the logical AND NOT of two packed double precision floating-point operands.

The **ORPD** (bitwise logical OR of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction returns the logical OR of two packed double precision floating-point operands.

The **XORPD** (bitwise logical XOR of packed double precision floating-point values) instruction returns the logical XOR of two packed double precision floating-point operands.

### 11.4.1.4 Intel® SSE2 Comparison Instructions

Intel SSE2 compare instructions compare packed and scalar double precision floating-point values and return the results of the comparison either to the destination operand or to the EFLAGS register.

The **CMPPD** (compare packed double precision floating-point values) instruction compares the corresponding values from two packed double precision floating-point operands, using an immediate operand as a predicate, and returns a 64-bit mask result of all 1s or all 0s for each comparison to the destination operand. The value of the immediate operand allows the selection of any of eight compare conditions: equal, less than, less than equal, unordered, not equal, not less than, not less than or equal, or ordered.

The **CMPSD** (compare scalar double precision floating-point values) instruction compares the low values from two packed double precision floating-point operands, using an immediate operand as a predicate, and returns a 64-bit mask result of all 1s or all 0s for the comparison to the low quadword of the destination operand. The immediate operand selects the compare condition as with the **CMPPD** instruction.

The **COMISD** (compare scalar double precision floating-point values and set EFLAGS) and **UCOMISD** (unordered compare scalar double precision floating-point values and set EFLAGS) instructions compare the low values of two packed double precision floating-point operands and set the ZF, PF, and CF flags in the EFLAGS register to show the result (greater than, less than, equal, or unordered). These two instructions differ as follows: the **COMISD** instruction signals a floating-point invalid-operation (#I) exception when a source operand is either a QNaN or an SNaN; the **UCOMISD** instruction only signals an invalid-operation exception when a source operand is an SNaN.

### 11.4.1.5 Intel® SSE2 Shuffle and Unpack Instructions

Intel SSE2 shuffle instructions shuffle the contents of two packed double precision floating-point values and store the results in the destination operand.

The **SHUFPD** (shuffle packed double precision floating-point values) instruction places either of the two packed double precision floating-point values from the destination operand in the low quadword of the destination operand, and places either of the two packed double precision floating-point values from source operand in the high quadword of the destination operand (see Figure 11-5). By using the same register for the source and destination operands, the **SHUFPD** instruction can swap two packed double precision floating-point values.

![Diagram of SHUFPS instruction operation showing a packed shuffle of source and destination registers.](32ce3ed5531f18aba05215c8f474bf49_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the SHUFPS instruction operation. It shows three horizontal bars representing registers. The top bar is labeled 'DEST' and contains two fields: 'X1' and 'X0'. The middle bar is labeled 'SRC' and contains two fields: 'Y1' and 'Y0'. The bottom bar is labeled 'DEST' and contains two fields: 'Y1 or Y0' and 'X1 or X0'. Arrows indicate the data flow: an arrow from 'X1' in the top bar points to 'X1 or X0' in the bottom bar; an arrow from 'X0' in the top bar points to 'Y1 or Y0' in the bottom bar; an arrow from 'Y1' in the middle bar points to 'Y1 or Y0' in the bottom bar; and an arrow from 'Y0' in the middle bar points to 'X1 or X0' in the bottom bar.

Diagram of SHUFPS instruction operation showing a packed shuffle of source and destination registers.

Figure 11-5. SHUFPS Instruction, Packed Shuffle Operation

The UNPCKHPD (unpack and interleave high packed double precision floating-point values) instruction performs an interleaved unpack of the high values from the source and destination operands and stores the result in the destination operand (see Figure 11-6).

The UNPCKLPD (unpack and interleave low packed double precision floating-point values) instruction performs an interleaved unpack of the low values from the source and destination operands and stores the result in the destination operand (see Figure 11-7).

![Diagram of UNPCKHPD instruction operation showing high unpack and interleave.](cc27e2ff34f735b68accec59748f7b6e_img.jpg)

The middle bar is labeled 'SRC' and contains two fields: 'Y1' and 'Y0'. The bottom bar is labeled 'DEST' and contains two fields: 'Y1' and 'X1'. Arrows indicate the data flow: an arrow from 'X1' in the top bar points to 'X1' in the bottom bar; an arrow from 'Y1' in the middle bar points to 'Y1' in the bottom bar.

PROGRAMMING WITH INTEL® STREAMING SIMD EXTENSIONS 2 (INTEL® SSE2)

### 11.4.1.6 Intel® SSE2 Conversion Instructions

Intel SSE2 conversion instructions (see Figure 11-8) support packed and scalar conversions between:

- Double precision and single precision floating-point formats.
- Double precision floating-point and doubleword integer formats.
- Single precision floating-point and doubleword integer formats.

**Conversion between double precision and single precision floating-points values —** The following instructions convert operands between double precision and single precision floating-point formats. The operands being operated on are contained in XMM registers or memory (at most, one operand can reside in memory; the destination is always an XMM register).

The CVTPS2PD (convert packed single precision floating-point values to packed double precision floating-point values) instruction converts two packed single precision floating-point values to two double precision floating-point values.

The CVTPD2PS (convert packed double precision floating-point values to packed single precision floating-point values) instruction converts two packed double precision floating-point values to two single precision floating-point values. When a conversion is inexact, the result is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register.

The CVTSS2SD (convert scalar single precision floating-point value to scalar double precision floating-point value) instruction converts a single precision floating-point value to a double precision floating-point value.

The CVTSD2SS (convert scalar double precision floating-point value to scalar single precision floating-point value) instruction converts a double precision floating-point value to a single precision floating-point value. When a conversion is inexact, the result is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register.

are housed in XMM registers, MMX registers, general registers or memory (at most one operand can reside in memory; the destination is always an XMM, MMX, or general register).

The CVTPD2PI (convert packed double precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction converts two packed double precision floating-point numbers to two packed signed doubleword integers, with the result stored in an MMX register. When rounding to an integer value, the source value is rounded according to the rounding mode in the MXCSR register. The CVTTPD2PI (convert with truncation packed double precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction is similar to the CVTPD2PI instruction except that truncation is used to round a source value to an integer value; see Section 4.8.4.2, “Truncation with Intel® SSE, SSE2, and AVX Conversion Instructions.”

The CVTPI2PD (convert packed doubleword integers to packed double precision floating-point values) instruction converts two packed signed doubleword integers to two double precision floating-point values.

The CVTPD2DQ (convert packed double precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction converts two packed double precision floating-point numbers to two packed signed doubleword integers, with the result stored in the low quadword of an XMM register. When rounding an integer value, the source value is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register. The CVTTPD2DQ (convert with truncation packed double precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction is similar to the CVTPD2DQ instruction except that truncation is used to round a source value to an integer value; see Section 4.8.4.2, “Truncation with Intel® SSE, SSE2, and AVX Conversion Instructions.”

The CVTDQ2PD (convert packed doubleword integers to packed double precision floating-point values) instruction converts two packed signed doubleword integers located in the low-order doublewords of an XMM register to two double precision floating-point values.

The CVTSD2SI (convert scalar double precision floating-point value to signed integer) instruction converts a double precision floating-point value to a signed integer, and stores the result in a general-purpose register. When rounding an integer value, the source value is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register. The CVTTPD2SI (convert with truncation scalar double precision floating-point value to signed integer) instruction is similar to the CVTSD2SI instruction except that truncation is used to round the source value to an integer value; see Section 4.8.4.2, “Truncation with Intel® SSE, SSE2, and AVX Conversion Instructions.”

The CVTSI2SD (convert signed integer to scalar double precision floating-point value) instruction converts a signed doubleword or quadword integer in a general-purpose register to a double precision floating-point number, and stores the result in an XMM register.

**Conversion between single precision floating-point and doubleword integer formats —** These instructions convert between packed single precision floating-point and packed doubleword integer formats. Operands are housed in XMM registers, MMX registers, general registers, or memory (the latter for at most one source operand). The destination is always an XMM, MMX, or general register. These SSE2 instructions supplement conversion instructions (CVTPI2PS, CVTPS2PI, CVTTPS2PI, CVTSI2SS, CVTSS2SI, and CVTTPS2SI) introduced with Intel SSE extensions.

The CVTPS2DQ (convert packed single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction converts four packed single precision floating-point values to four packed signed doubleword integers, with the source and destination operands in XMM registers or memory (the latter for at most one source operand). When the conversion is inexact, the rounded value according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register is returned. The CVTTPS2DQ (convert with truncation packed single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction is similar to the CVTPS2DQ instruction except that truncation is used to round a source value to an integer value; see Section 4.8.4.2, “Truncation with Intel® SSE, SSE2, and AVX Conversion Instructions.”

The CVTDQ2PS (convert packed doubleword integers to packed single precision floating-point values) instruction converts four packed signed doubleword integers to four packed single precision floating-point numbers, with the source and destination operands in XMM registers or memory (the latter for at most one source operand). When the conversion is inexact, the rounded value according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register is returned.

## 11.4.2 Intel® SSE2 64-Bit and 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions

Intel SSE2 adds several 128-bit packed integer instructions to the IA-32 architecture. Where appropriate, a 64-bit version of each of these instructions is also provided. The 128-bit versions of instructions operate on data in XMM registers; 64-bit versions operate on data in MMX registers. The instructions follow.

The **MOVDQA** (move aligned double quadword) instruction transfers a double quadword operand from memory to an XMM register or vice versa; or between XMM registers. The memory address must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary; otherwise, a general-protection exception (#GP) is generated.

The **MOVDQU** (move unaligned double quadword) instruction performs the same operations as the **MOVDQA** instruction, except that 16-byte alignment of a memory address is not required.

The **PADDQ** (packed quadword add) instruction adds two packed quadword integer operands or two single quadword integer operands, and stores the results in an XMM or MMX register, respectively. This instruction can operate on either unsigned or signed (two's complement notation) integer operands.

The **PSUBQ** (packed quadword subtract) instruction subtracts two packed quadword integer operands or two single quadword integer operands, and stores the results in an XMM or MMX register, respectively. Like the **PADDQ** instruction, **PSUBQ** can operate on either unsigned or signed (two's complement notation) integer operands.

The **PMULUDQ** (multiply packed unsigned doubleword integers) instruction performs an unsigned multiply of unsigned doubleword integers and returns a quadword result. Both 64-bit and 128-bit versions of this instruction are available. The 64-bit version operates on two doubleword integers stored in the low doubleword of each source operand, and the quadword result is returned to an MMX register. The 128-bit version performs a packed multiply of two pairs of doubleword integers. Here, the doublewords are packed in the first and third doublewords of the source operands, and the quadword results are stored in the low and high quadwords of an XMM register.

The **PSHUFLW** (shuffle packed low words) instruction shuffles the word integers packed into the low quadword of the source operand and stores the shuffled result in the low quadword of the destination operand. An 8-bit immediate operand specifies the shuffle order.

The **PSHUFW** (shuffle packed high words) instruction shuffles the word integers packed into the high quadword of the source operand and stores the shuffled result in the high quadword of the destination operand. An 8-bit immediate operand specifies the shuffle order.

The **PSHUFD** (shuffle packed doubleword integers) instruction shuffles the doubleword integers packed into the source operand and stores the shuffled result in the destination operand. An 8-bit immediate operand specifies the shuffle order.

The **PSLLDQ** (shift double quadword left logical) instruction shifts the contents of the source operand to the left by the amount of bytes specified by an immediate operand. The empty low-order bytes are cleared (set to 0).

The **PSRLDQ** (shift double quadword right logical) instruction shifts the contents of the source operand to the right by the amount of bytes specified by an immediate operand. The empty high-order bytes are cleared (set to 0).

The **PUNPCKHQDQ** (Unpack high quadwords) instruction interleaves the high quadword of the source operand and the high quadword of the destination operand and writes them to the destination register.

The **PUNPCKLQDQ** (Unpack low quadwords) instruction interleaves the low quadwords of the source operand and the low quadwords of the destination operand and writes them to the destination register.

Two additional SSE instructions enable data movement from the MMX registers to the XMM registers.

The **MOVQ2DQ** (move quadword integer from MMX to XMM registers) instruction moves the quadword integer from an MMX source register to an XMM destination register.

The **MOVDQ2Q** (move quadword integer from XMM to MMX registers) instruction moves the low quadword integer from an XMM source register to an MMX destination register.

## 11.4.3 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instruction Extensions

All of 64-bit SIMD integer instructions introduced with MMX technology and Intel SSE (with the exception of the **PSHUFW** instruction) have been extended by Intel SSE2 to operate on 128-bit packed integer operands located in XMM registers. The 128-bit versions of these instructions follow the same SIMD conventions regarding packed

operands as the 64-bit versions. For example, where the 64-bit version of the PADDB instruction operates on 8 packed bytes, the 128-bit version operates on 16 packed bytes.

## 11.4.4 Cacheability Control and Memory Ordering Instructions

Intel SSE2 instructions that give programs more control over the caching, loading, and storing of data, are described below.

### 11.4.4.1 FLUSH Cache Line

The CLFLUSH (flush cache line) instruction writes and invalidates the cache line associated with a specified linear address. The invalidation is for all levels of the processor's cache hierarchy, and it is broadcast throughout the cache coherency domain.

#### NOTE

CLFLUSH was introduced with Intel SSE2. However, the instruction can be implemented in IA-32 processors that do not implement Intel SSE2. Detect CLFLUSH using the feature bit (if CPUID.01H:EDX.CLFLUSH[19] = 1).

### 11.4.4.2 Cacheability Control Instructions

The following four instructions enable data from XMM and general-purpose registers to be stored to memory using a non-temporal hint. The non-temporal hint directs the processor to store data to memory without writing the data into the cache hierarchy. See Section 10.4.6.2, "Caching of Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data," for more information about non-temporal stores and hints.

The MOVNTDQ (store double quadword using non-temporal hint) instruction stores packed integer data from an XMM register to memory, using a non-temporal hint.

The MOVNTPD (store packed double precision floating-point values using non-temporal hint) instruction stores packed double precision floating-point data from an XMM register to memory, using a non-temporal hint.

The MOVNTI (store doubleword using non-temporal hint) instruction stores integer data from a general-purpose register to memory, using a non-temporal hint.

The MASKMOVDQU (store selected bytes of double quadword) instruction stores selected byte integers from an XMM register to memory, using a byte mask to selectively write the individual bytes. The memory location does not need to be aligned on a natural boundary. This instruction also uses a non-temporal hint.

### 11.4.4.3 Memory Ordering Instructions

Intel SSE2 introduced two fence instructions (LFENCE and MFENCE) as companions to the SFENCE instruction introduced with Intel SSE.

The LFENCE instruction establishes a memory fence for loads. It guarantees ordering between two loads and prevents speculative loads from passing the load fence (that is, no speculative loads are allowed until all loads specified before the load fence have been carried out).

The MFENCE instruction establishes a memory fence for both loads and stores. The processor ensures that no load or store after MFENCE will become globally visible until all loads and stores before MFENCE are globally visible.<sup>1</sup> Note that the sequences LFENCE;SFENCE and SFENCE;LFENCE are not equivalent to MFENCE because neither ensures that older stores are globally observed prior to younger loads.

### 11.4.4.4 Pause

The PAUSE instruction is provided to improve the performance of "spin-wait loops" executed on a Pentium 4 or Intel Xeon processor. On a Pentium 4 processor, it also provides the added benefit of reducing processor power

1. A load is considered to become globally visible when the value to be loaded is determined.

consumption while executing a spin-wait loop. It is recommended that a PAUSE instruction always be included in the code sequence for a spin-wait loop.

### 11.4.5 Branch Hints

Intel SSE2 designates two instruction prefixes (2EH and 3EH) to provide branch hints to the processor (see “Instruction Prefixes” in Chapter 2 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A). These prefixes can only be used with the Jcc instruction and only at the machine code level (that is, there are no mnemonics for the branch hints).

## 11.5 INTEL® SSE, SSE2, AND SSE3 EXCEPTIONS

Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instructions generate two general types of exceptions:

- Non-numeric exceptions.
- SIMD floating-point exceptions.<sup>1</sup>

Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instructions can generate the same type of memory-access and non-numeric exceptions as other IA-32 architecture instructions. Existing exception handlers can generally handle these exceptions without any code modification. See “Providing Non-Numeric Exception Handlers for Exceptions Generated by the SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 Instructions” in Chapter 16 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for a list of the non-numeric exceptions that can be generated by the Intel SSE, SSE2, SSE3 instructions and for guidelines for handling these exceptions.

Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instructions do not generate numeric exceptions on packed integer operations; however, they can generate numeric (SIMD floating-point) exceptions on packed single precision and double precision floating-point operations. These SIMD floating-point exceptions are defined in the IEEE Standard 754 for Floating-Point Arithmetic and are the same exceptions that are generated for x87 FPU instructions. See Section 11.5.1, “SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions,” for a description of these exceptions.

### 11.5.1 SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions

SIMD floating-point exceptions are those exceptions that can be generated by Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instructions that operate on packed or scalar floating-point operands.

Six classes of SIMD floating-point exceptions can be generated:

- Invalid operation (#I).
- Divide-by-zero (#Z).
- Denormal operand (#D).
- Numeric overflow (#O).
- Numeric underflow (#U).
- Inexact result (Precision) (#P).

All of these exceptions (except the denormal operand exception) are defined in IEEE Standard 754, and they are the same exceptions that are generated with the x87 floating-point instructions. Section 4.9, “Overview of Floating-Point Exceptions,” gives a detailed description of these exceptions and of how and when they are generated. The following sections discuss the implementation of these exceptions in the Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 extensions.

All SIMD floating-point exceptions are precise and occur as soon as the instruction completes execution.

---

1. The FISTTP instruction in Intel SSE3 does not generate SIMD floating-point exceptions, but it can generate x87 FPU floating-point exceptions.

Each of the six exception conditions has a corresponding flag (IE, DE, ZE, OE, UE, and PE) and mask bit (IM, DM, ZM, OM, UM, and PM) in the MXCSR register (see Figure 10-3). The mask bits can be set with the LDMXCSR or FXRSTOR instruction; the mask and flag bits can be read with the STMXCSR or FXSAVE instruction.

The OSXMMEXCEPT flag (bit 10) of control register CR4 provides additional control over generation of SIMD floating-point exceptions by allowing the operating system to indicate whether or not it supports software exception handlers for SIMD floating-point exceptions. If an unmasked SIMD floating-point exception is generated and the OSXMMEXCEPT flag is set, the processor invokes a software exception handler by generating a SIMD floating-point exception (#XM). If the OSXMMEXCEPT bit is clear, the processor generates an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) on the first Intel SSE or SSE2 instruction that detects a SIMD floating-point exception condition. See Section 11.6.2, “Checking for Intel® SSE and SSE2 Support.”

## 11.5.2 SIMD Floating-Point Exception Conditions

The following sections describe the conditions that cause a SIMD floating-point exception to be generated and the masked response of the processor when these conditions are detected.

See Section 4.9.2, “Floating-Point Exception Priority,” for a description of the rules for exception precedence when more than one floating-point exception condition is detected for an instruction.

### 11.5.2.1 Invalid Operation Exception (#I)

The floating-point invalid-operation exception (#I) occurs in response to an invalid arithmetic operand. The flag (IE) and mask (IM) bits for the invalid operation exception are bits 0 and 7, respectively, in the MXCSR register.

If the invalid-operation exception is masked, the processor returns a QNaN, QNaN floating-point indefinite, integer indefinite, one of the source operands to the destination operand, or it sets the EFLAGS, depending on the operation being performed. When a value is returned to the destination operand, it overwrites the destination register specified by the instruction. Table 11-1 lists the invalid-arithmetic operations that the processor detects for instructions and the masked responses to these operations.

| Conversion to integer when the value in the source register is a NaN, $\infty$ , or exceeds the representable range for CVTTPS2PI, CVTTPS2PI, CVTSS2SI, CVTSS2SI, CVTPD2PI, CVTSD2SI, CVTPD2DQ, CVTTPD2PI, CVTSS2SI, CVTTPD2DQ, CVTTPS2DQ, or CVTTPS2DQ | Return the integer Indefinite. |

If the invalid operation exception is not masked, a software exception handler is invoked and the operands remain unchanged. See Section 11.5.4, “Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software.”

Normally, when one or more of the source operands are QNaNs (and neither is an SNaN or in an unsupported format), an invalid-operation exception is not generated. The following instructions are exceptions to this rule: the COMISS and COMISD instructions; and the CMPPS, CMPSS, CMPPD, and CMPSD instructions (when the predicate is less than, less-than or equal, not less-than, or not less-than or equal). With these instructions, a QNaN source operand will generate an invalid-operation exception.

The invalid-operation exception is not affected by the flush-to-zero mode or by the denormals-are-zeros mode.

### 11.5.2.2 Denormal-Operand Exception (#D)

The processor signals the denormal-operand exception if an arithmetic instruction attempts to operate on a denormal operand. The flag (DE) and mask (DM) bits for the denormal-operand exception are bits 1 and 8, respectively, in the MXCSR register.

The CVTPI2PD, CVTPD2PI, CVTTPD2PI, CVTDQ2PD, CVTPD2DQ, CVTTPD2DQ, CVTSI2SD, CVTSD2SI, CVTSS2SI, CVTPI2PS, CVTPS2PI, CVTTPS2PI, CVTSS2SI, CVTSS2SI, CVTSI2SS, CVTDQ2PS, CVTPS2DQ, and CVTTPS2DQ conversion instructions do not signal denormal exceptions. The RCPSS, RCPPS, RSQRTSS, and RSQRTPS instructions do not signal any kind of floating-point exception.

The denormals-are-zero flag (bit 6) of the MXCSR register provides an additional option for handling denormal-operand exceptions. When this flag is set, denormal source operands are automatically converted to zeros with the sign of the source operand (see Section 10.2.3.4, “Denormals-Are-Zeros”). The denormal operand exception is not affected by the flush-to-zero mode.

See Section 4.9.1.2, “Denormal Operand Exception (#D),” for more information about the denormal exception. See Section 11.5.4, “Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software,” for information on handling unmasked exceptions.

### 11.5.2.3 Divide-By-Zero Exception (#Z)

The processor reports a divide-by-zero exception when a DIVPS, DIVSS, DIVPD or DIVSD instruction attempts to divide a finite non-zero operand by 0. The flag (ZE) and mask (ZM) bits for the divide-by-zero exception are bits 2 and 9, respectively, in the MXCSR register.

See Section 4.9.1.3, “Divide-By-Zero Exception (#Z),” for more information about the divide-by-zero exception. See Section 11.5.4, “Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software,” for information on handling unmasked exceptions.

The divide-by-zero exception is not affected by the flush-to-zero mode at a single-instruction boundary.

While DAZ does not affect the rules for signaling IEEE exceptions, operations on denormal inputs might have different results when DAZ=1. As a consequence, DAZ can have an effect on the floating-point exceptions - including the divide-by-zero exception - when observed for a given operation involving denormal inputs.

### 11.5.2.4 Numeric Overflow Exception (#O)

The processor reports a numeric overflow exception whenever the rounded result of an arithmetic instruction exceeds the largest allowable finite value that fits in the destination operand. This exception can be generated with the ADDPS, ADDSS, ADDPD, ADDSD, SUBPS, SUBSS, SUBPD, SUBSD, MULPS, MULSS, MULPD, MULSD, DIVPS, DIVSS, DIVPD, DIVSD, CVTPD2PS, CVTSD2SS, ADDSUBPD, ADDSUBPS, HADDPD, HADDPs, HSUBPD, and

HSUBPS instructions. The flag (OE) and mask (OM) bits for the numeric overflow exception are bits 3 and 10, respectively, in the MXCSR register.

See Section 4.9.1.4, “Numeric Overflow Exception (#O),” for more information about the numeric-overflow exception. See Section 11.5.4, “Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software,” for information on handling unmasked exceptions.

The numeric overflow exception is not affected by the flush-to-zero mode or by the denormals-are-zeros mode.

### 11.5.2.5 Numeric Underflow Exception (#U)

The processor reports a numeric underflow exception whenever the magnitude of the rounded result of an arithmetic instruction, with unbounded exponent, is less than the smallest possible normalized, finite value that will fit in the destination operand and the numeric-underflow exception is not masked. If the numeric underflow exception is masked, both underflow and the inexact-result condition must be detected before numeric underflow is reported. This exception can be generated with the ADDPS, ADDSS, ADDPD, ADDSD, SUBPS, SUBSS, SUBPD, SUBSD, MULPS, MULSS, MULPD, MULSD, DIVPS, DIVSS, DIVPD, DIVSD, CVTPD2PS, CVTSD2SS, ADDSUBPD, ADDSUBPS, HADDPD, HADDPS, HSUBPD, and HSUBPS instructions. The flag (UE) and mask (UM) bits for the numeric underflow exception are bits 4 and 11, respectively, in the MXCSR register.

The flush-to-zero flag (bit 15) of the MXCSR register provides an additional option for handling numeric underflow exceptions. When this flag is set and the numeric underflow exception is masked, tiny results are returned as a zero with the sign of the true result; see Section 10.2.3.3, “Flush-To-Zero.”

Underflow will occur when a tiny non-zero result is detected (the result has to be also inexact if underflow exceptions are masked), as described in the IEEE Standard 754-2008. While DAZ does not affect the rules for signaling IEEE exceptions, operations on denormal inputs might have different results when DAZ=1. As a consequence, DAZ can have an effect on the floating-point exceptions - including the underflow exception - when observed for a given operation involving denormal inputs.

See Section 4.9.1.5, “Numeric Underflow Exception (#U),” for more information about the numeric underflow exception. See Section 11.5.4, “Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software,” for information on handling unmasked exceptions.

### 11.5.2.6 Inexact-Result (Precision) Exception (#P)

The inexact-result exception (also called the precision exception) occurs if the result of an operation is not exactly representable in the destination format. For example, the fraction 1/3 cannot be precisely represented in binary form. This exception occurs frequently and indicates that some (normally acceptable) accuracy has been lost. The exception is supported for applications that need to perform exact arithmetic only. Because the rounded result is generally satisfactory for most applications, this exception is commonly masked.

The flag (PE) and mask (PM) bits for the inexact-result exception are bits 5 and 12, respectively, in the MXCSR register.

See Section 4.9.1.6, “Inexact-Result (Precision) Exception (#P),” for more information about the inexact-result exception. See Section 11.5.4, “Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software,” for information on handling unmasked exceptions.

In flush-to-zero mode, the inexact result exception is reported.

## 11.5.3 Generating SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions

When the processor executes a packed or scalar floating-point instruction, it looks for and reports on SIMD floating-point exception conditions using two sequential steps:

1. Looks for, reports on, and handles pre-computation exception conditions (invalid-operand, divide-by-zero, and denormal operand)
2. Looks for, reports on, and handles post-computation exception conditions (numeric overflow, numeric underflow, and inexact result)

If both pre- and post-computational exceptions are unmasked, it is possible for the processor to generate a SIMD floating-point exception (#XM) twice during the execution of an SSE, SSE2 or SSE3 instruction: once when it detects and handles a pre-computational exception and when it detects a post-computational exception.

### 11.5.3.1 Handling Masked Exceptions

If all exceptions are masked, the processor handles the exceptions it detects by placing the masked result (or results for packed operands) in a destination operand and continuing program execution. The masked result may be a rounded normalized value, signed infinity, a denormal finite number, zero, a QNaN floating-point indefinite, or a QNaN depending on the exception condition detected. In most cases, the corresponding exception flag bit in MXCSR is also set. The one situation where an exception flag is not set is when an underflow condition is detected and it is not accompanied by an inexact result.

When operating on packed floating-point operands, the processor returns a masked result for each of the sub-operand computations and sets a separate set of internal exception flags for each computation. It then performs a logical-OR on the internal exception flag settings and sets the exception flags in the MXCSR register according to the results of OR operations.

For example, Figure 11-9 shows the results of an MULPS instruction. In the example, all SIMD floating-point exceptions are masked. Assume that a denormal exception condition is detected prior to the multiplication of sub-operands X0 and Y0, no exception condition is detected for the multiplication of X1 and Y1, a numeric overflow exception condition is detected for the multiplication of X2 and Y2, and another denormal exception is detected prior to the multiplication of sub-operands X3 and Y3. Because denormal exceptions are masked, the processor uses the denormal source values in the multiplications of (X0 and Y0) and of (X3 and Y3) passing the results of the multiplications through to the destination operand. With the denormal operand, the result of the X0 and Y0 computation is a normalized finite value, with no exceptions detected. However, the X3 and Y3 computation produces a tiny and inexact result. This causes the corresponding internal numeric underflow and inexact-result exception flags to be set.

![Figure 11-9: Example Masked Response for Packed Operations. A diagram showing four parallel multiplication operations (MULPS) on packed floating-point operands. The operands are arranged in two rows: X3, X2, X1, X0 (Denormal) in the top row and Y3 (Denormal), Y2, Y1, Y0 in the bottom row. Arrows point from each pair of operands to a MULPS operation.

Figure 11-9: Example Masked Response for Packed Operations. A diagram showing four parallel multiplication operations (MULPS) on packed floating-point operands. The operands are arranged in two rows: X3, X2, X1, X0 (Denormal) in the top row and Y3 (Denormal), Y2, Y1, Y0 in the bottom row. Arrows point from each pair of operands to a MULPS operation. The results are shown in a bottom row: 'Tiny, Inexact, Finite' for X3\*Y3, '∞' for X2\*Y2, 'Normalized Finite' for X1\*Y1, and 'Normalized Finite' for X0\*Y0.

**Figure 11-9. Example Masked Response for Packed Operations**

For the multiplication of X2 and Y2, the processor stores the floating-point  $\infty$  in the destination operand, and sets the corresponding internal sub-operand numeric overflow flag. The result of the X1 and Y1 multiplication is passed through to the destination operand, with no internal sub-operand exception flags being set. Following the computations, the individual sub-operand exceptions flags for denormal operand, numeric underflow, inexact result, and numeric overflow are OR'd and the corresponding flags are set in the MXCSR register.

The net result of this computation is that:

- Multiplication of X0 and Y0 produces a normalized finite result
- Multiplication of X1 and Y1 produces a normalized finite result
- Multiplication of X2 and Y2 produces a floating-point  $\infty$  result
- Multiplication of X3 and Y3 produces a tiny, inexact, finite result

- Denormal operand, numeric underflow, numeric underflow, and inexact result flags are set in the MXCSR register

### 11.5.3.2 Handling Unmasked Exceptions

If all exceptions are unmasked, the processor:

1. First detects any pre-computation exceptions: it ORs those exceptions, sets the appropriate exception flags, leaves the source and destination operands unaltered, and goes to step 2. If it does not detect any pre-computation exceptions, it goes to step 5.
2. Checks CR4.OSXMMEXCPT[bit 10]. If this flag is set, the processor goes to step 3; if the flag is clear, it generates an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) and makes an implicit call to the invalid-opcode exception handler.
3. Generates a SIMD floating-point exception (#XM) and makes an implicit call to the SIMD floating-point exception handler.
4. If the exception handler is able to fix the source operands that generated the pre-computation exceptions or mask the condition in such a way as to allow the processor to continue executing the instruction, the processor resumes instruction execution as described in step 5.
5. Upon returning from the exception handler (or if no pre-computation exceptions were detected), the processor checks for post-computation exceptions. If the processor detects any post-computation exceptions: it ORs those exceptions, sets the appropriate exception flags, leaves the source and destination operands unaltered, and repeats steps 2, 3, and 4.
6. Upon returning from the exceptions handler in step 4 (or if no post-computation exceptions were detected), the processor completes the execution of the instruction.

The implication of this procedure is that for unmasked exceptions, the processor can generate a SIMD floating-point exception (#XM) twice: once if it detects pre-computation exception conditions and a second time if it detects post-computation exception conditions. For example, if SIMD floating-point exceptions are unmasked for the computation shown in Figure 11-9, the processor would generate one SIMD floating-point exception for denormal operand conditions and a second SIMD floating-point exception for overflow and underflow (no inexact result exception would be generated because the multiplications of X0 and Y0 and of X1 and Y1 are exact).

### 11.5.3.3 Handling Combinations of Masked and Unmasked Exceptions

In situations where both masked and unmasked exceptions are detected, the processor will set exception flags for the masked and the unmasked exceptions. However, it will not return masked results until after the processor has detected and handled unmasked post-computation exceptions and returned from the exception handler (as in step 6 above) to finish executing the instruction.

## 11.5.4 Handling SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions in Software

Section 4.9.3, “Typical Actions of a Floating-Point Exception Handler,” shows actions that may be carried out by a SIMD floating-point exception handler. The SSE/SSE2/SSE3 state is saved with the FXSAVE instruction; see Section 11.6.5, “Saving and Restoring the SSE/SSE2 State.”

## 11.5.5 Interaction of SIMD and x87 FPU Floating-Point Exceptions

SIMD floating-point exceptions are generated independently from x87 FPU floating-point exceptions. SIMD floating-point exceptions do not cause assertion of the FERR# pin (independent of the value of CR0.NE[bit 5]). They ignore the assertion and deassertion of the IGNNE# pin.

If applications use Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions along with x87 FPU instructions (in the same task or program), consider the following:

- SIMD floating-point exceptions are reported independently from the x87 FPU floating-point exceptions. SIMD and x87 FPU floating-point exceptions can be unmasked independently. Separate x87 FPU and SIMD floating-

point exception handlers must be provided if the same exception is unmasked for x87 FPU and for Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 operations.

- The rounding mode specified in the MXCSR register does not affect x87 FPU instructions. Likewise, the rounding mode specified in the x87 FPU control word does not affect the Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions. To use the same rounding mode, the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register and in the x87 FPU control word must be set explicitly to the same value.
- The flush-to-zero mode set in the MXCSR register for Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions has no counterpart in the x87 FPU. For compatibility with the x87 FPU, set the flush-to-zero bit to 0.
- The denormals-are-zeros mode set in the MXCSR register for Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions has no counterpart in the x87 FPU. For compatibility with the x87 FPU, set the denormals-are-zeros bit to 0.
- An application that expects to detect x87 FPU exceptions that occur during the execution of x87 FPU instructions will not be notified if exceptions occurs during the execution of corresponding Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3<sup>1</sup> instructions, unless the exception masks that are enabled in the x87 FPU control word have also been enabled in the MXCSR register and the application is capable of handling SIMD floating-point exceptions (#XM).
  - Masked exceptions that occur during an SSE/SSE2/SSE3 library call cannot be detected by unmasking the exceptions after the call (in an attempt to generate the fault based on the fact that an exception flag is set). A SIMD floating-point exception flag that is set when the corresponding exception is unmasked will not generate a fault; only the next occurrence of that unmasked exception will generate a fault.
  - An application which checks the x87 FPU status word to determine if any masked exception flags were set during an x87 FPU library call will also need to check the MXCSR register to detect a similar occurrence of a masked exception flag being set during an SSE/SSE2/SSE3 library call.

## 11.6 WRITING APPLICATIONS WITH INTEL® SSE AND SSE2

The following sections give some guidelines for writing application programs and operating-system code that uses Intel SSE and SSE2. Because Intel SSE and SSE2 share the same state and perform companion operations, these guidelines apply to both sets of extensions.

Chapter 16 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A, discusses the interface to the processor for context switching as well as other operating system considerations when writing code that uses Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3.

### 11.6.1 General Guidelines for Using Intel® SSE and SSE2

The following guidelines describe how to take full advantage of the performance gains available with Intel SSE and SSE2:

- Ensure that the processor supports Intel SSE and SSE2.
- Ensure that your operating system supports Intel SSE and SSE2. (Operating system support for Intel SSE implies support for Intel SSE2, and vice versa.)
- Use stack and data alignment techniques to keep data properly aligned for efficient memory use.
- Use the non-temporal store instructions offered with Intel SSE and SSE2.
- Employ the optimization and scheduling techniques described in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual; see Section 1.4, "Related Literature," for the order number for this manual.

### 11.6.2 Checking for Intel® SSE and SSE2 Support

Before an application attempts to use Intel SSE and/or Intel SSE2, it should check that they are present on the processor:

---

1. Intel SSE3 refers to ADDSUBPD, ADDSUBPS, HADDPD, HADDPS, HSUBPD, and HSUBPS. The only other Intel SSE3 instruction that can raise floating-point exceptions is FISTTP; it can generate x87 FPU invalid operation and inexact result exceptions.

1. Check that the processor supports the CPUID instruction. Bit 21 of the EFLAGS register can be used to check processor's support the CPUID instruction.
2. Check that the processor supports Intel SSE and/or SSE2 (true if CPUID.01H:EDX.SSE[25] = 1 and/or CPUID.01H:EDX.SSE2[26] = 1).

The operating system must provide system level support for handling SSE state, exceptions before an application can use Intel SSE and/or Intel SSE2; see Chapter 16 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A.

If the processor attempts to execute an unsupported Intel SSE or SSE2 instruction, the processor will generate an invalid-opcode exception (#UD). If an operating system did not provide adequate system level support for Intel SSE, executing an Intel SSE or SSE2 instructions can also generate #UD.

### 11.6.3 Checking for the DAZ Flag in the MXCSR Register

The denormals-are-zero flag in the MXCSR register is available in most of the Pentium 4 processors and in the Intel Xeon processor, with the exception of some early steppings. To check for the presence of the DAZ flag in the MXCSR register, do the following:

1. Establish a 512-byte FXSAVE area in memory.
2. Clear the FXSAVE area to all 0s.
3. Execute the FXSAVE instruction, using the address of the first byte of the cleared FXSAVE area as a source operand. See "FXSAVE—Save x87 FPU, MMX, SSE, and SSE2 State" in Chapter 3 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for a description of the FXSAVE instruction and the layout of the FXSAVE image.
4. Check the value in the MXCSR\_MASK field in the FXSAVE image (bytes 28 through 31).
  - If the value of the MXCSR\_MASK field is 00000000H, the DAZ flag and denormals-are-zero mode are not supported.
  - If the value of the MXCSR\_MASK field is non-zero and bit 6 is set, the DAZ flag and denormals-are-zero mode are supported.

If the DAZ flag is not supported, then it is a reserved bit and attempting to write a 1 to it will cause a general-protection exception (#GP). See Section 11.6.6, "Guidelines for Writing to the MXCSR Register," for general guidelines for preventing general-protection exceptions when writing to the MXCSR register.

### 11.6.4 Initialization of Intel® SSE and SSE2

The SSE and SSE2 state is contained in the XMM and MXCSR registers. Upon a hardware reset of the processor, this state is initialized as follows (see Table 11-2):

- All SIMD floating-point exceptions are masked (bits 7 through 12 of the MXCSR register is set to 1).
- All SIMD floating-point exception flags are cleared (bits 0 through 5 of the MXCSR register is set to 0).
- The rounding control is set to round-nearest (bits 13 and 14 of the MXCSR register are set to 00B).
- The flush-to-zero mode is disabled (bit 15 of the MXCSR register is set to 0).
- The denormals-are-zeros mode is disabled (bit 6 of the MXCSR register is set to 0). If the denormals-are-zeros mode is not supported, this bit is reserved and will be set to 0 on initialization.
- Each of the XMM registers is cleared (set to all zeros).

Table 11-2. SSE and SSE2 State Following a Power-up/Reset or INIT

| Registers         | Power-Up or Reset | INIT      |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| XMM0 through XMM7 | +0.0              | Unchanged |
| MXCSR             | 1F80H             | Unchanged |

If the processor is reset by asserting the INIT# pin, the SSE and SSE2 state is not changed.

## 11.6.5 Saving and Restoring the SSE/SSE2 State

The FXSAVE instruction saves the x87 FPU, MMX, SSE, and SSE2 states (which includes the contents of eight XMM registers and the MXCSR registers) in a 512-byte block of memory. The FXRSTOR instruction restores the saved SSE and SSE2 state from memory. See the FXSAVE instruction in Chapter 3 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for the layout of the 512-byte state block.

In addition to saving and restoring the SSE and SSE2 state, FXSAVE and FXRSTOR also save and restore the x87 FPU state (because MMX registers are aliased to the x87 FPU data registers this includes saving and restoring the MMX state). For greater code efficiency, it is suggested that FXSAVE and FXRSTOR be substituted for the FSAVE, FNSAVE, and FRSTOR instructions in the following situations:

- When a context switch is being made in a multitasking environment
- During calls and returns from interrupt and exception handlers

In situations where the code is switching between x87 FPU and MMX technology computations (without a context switch or a call to an interrupt or exception), the FSAVE/FNSAVE and FRSTOR instructions are more efficient than the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions.

## 11.6.6 Guidelines for Writing to the MXCSR Register

The MXCSR has several reserved bits, and attempting to write a 1 to any of these bits will cause a general-protection exception (#GP) to be generated. To allow software to identify these reserved bits, the MXCSR\_MASK value is provided. Software can determine this mask value as follows:

1. Establish a 512-byte FXSAVE area in memory.
2. Clear the FXSAVE area to all 0s.
3. Execute the FXSAVE instruction, using the address of the first byte of the cleared FXSAVE area as a source operand. See "FXSAVE—Save x87 FPU, MMX, SSE, and SSE2 State" in Chapter 3 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for a description of FXSAVE and the layout of the FXSAVE image.
4. Check the value in the MXCSR\_MASK field in the FXSAVE image (bytes 28 through 31).
  - If the value of the MXCSR\_MASK field is 00000000H, then the MXCSR\_MASK value is the default value of 0000FFBFH. Note that this value indicates that bit 6 of the MXCSR register is reserved; this setting indicates that the denormals-are-zero mode is not supported on the processor.
  - If the value of the MXCSR\_MASK field is non-zero, the MXCSR\_MASK value should be used as the MXCSR\_MASK.

All bits set to 0 in the MXCSR\_MASK value indicate reserved bits in the MXCSR register. Thus, if the MXCSR\_MASK value is AND'd with a value to be written into the MXCSR register, the resulting value will be assured of having all its reserved bits set to 0, preventing the possibility of a general-protection exception being generated when the value is written to the MXCSR register.

For example, the default MXCSR\_MASK value when 00000000H is returned in the FXSAVE image is 0000FFBFH. If software AND's a value to be written to MXCSR register with 0000FFBFH, bit 6 of the result (the DAZ flag) will be ensured of being set to 0, which is the required setting to prevent general-protection exceptions on processors that do not support the denormals-are-zero mode.

To prevent general-protection exceptions, the MXCSR\_MASK value should be AND'd with the value to be written into the MXCSR register in the following situations:

- Operating system routines that receive a parameter from an application program and then write that value to the MXCSR register (either with an FXRSTOR or LDMXCSR instruction)
- Any application program that writes to the MXCSR register and that needs to run robustly on several different IA-32 processors

Note that all bits in the MXCSR\_MASK value that are set to 1 indicate features that are supported by the MXCSR register; they can be treated as feature flags for identifying processor capabilities.

## 11.6.7 Interaction of Intel® SSE and SSE2 Instructions with x87 FPU and MMX Instructions

The XMM registers and the x87 FPU and MMX registers represent separate execution environments, which has certain ramifications when executing Intel SSE, SSE2, MMX, and x87 FPU instructions in the same code module or when mixing code modules that contain these instructions:

- Those Intel SSE and SSE2 instructions that operate only on XMM registers (such as the packed and scalar floating-point instructions and the 128-bit SIMD integer instructions) in the same instruction stream with 64-bit SIMD integer or x87 FPU instructions without any restrictions. For example, an application can perform the majority of its floating-point computations in the XMM registers, using the packed and scalar floating-point instructions, and at the same time use the x87 FPU to perform trigonometric and other transcendental computations. Likewise, an application can perform packed 64-bit and 128-bit SIMD integer operations together without restrictions.
- Those Intel SSE and SSE2 instructions that operate on MMX registers (such as the CVTTPS2PI, CVTTPS2PI, CVTPI2PS, CVTPD2PI, CVTTPD2PI, CVTPI2PD, MOVDQ2Q, MOVQ2DQ, PADDQ, and PSUBQ instructions) can also be executed in the same instruction stream as 64-bit SIMD integer or x87 FPU instructions, however, here they are subject to the restrictions on the simultaneous use of MMX technology and x87 FPU instructions, which include:
  - Transition from x87 FPU to MMX technology instructions or to Intel SSE or SSE2 instructions that operate on MMX registers should be preceded by saving the state of the x87 FPU.
  - Transition from MMX technology instructions or from Intel SSE or SSE2 instructions that operate on MMX registers to x87 FPU instructions should be preceded by execution of the EMMS instruction.

## 11.6.8 Compatibility of SIMD and x87 FPU Floating-Point Data Types

Intel SSE and SSE2 instructions operate on the same single precision and double precision floating-point data types that the x87 FPU operates on. However, when operating on these data types, Intel SSE and SSE2 operate on them in their native format (single precision or double precision), in contrast to the x87 FPU which extends them to double extended precision floating-point format to perform computations and then rounds the result back to a single precision or double precision format before writing results to memory. Because the x87 FPU operates on a higher precision format and then rounds the result to a lower precision format, it may return a slightly different result when performing the same operation on the same single precision or double precision floating-point values than is returned by Intel SSE and SSE2. The difference occurs only in the least-significant bits of the significand.

## 11.6.9 Mixing Packed and Scalar Floating-Point and 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions and Data

Intel SSE and SSE2 define typed operations on packed and scalar floating-point data types and on 128-bit SIMD integer data types, but IA-32 processors do not enforce this typing at the architectural level. They only enforce it at the microarchitectural level. Therefore, when a Pentium 4 or Intel Xeon processor loads a packed or scalar floating-point operand or a 128-bit packed integer operand from memory into an XMM register, it does not check that the actual data being loaded matches the data type specified in the instruction. Likewise, when the processor performs an arithmetic operation on the data in an XMM register, it does not check that the data being operated on matches the data type specified in the instruction.

As a general rule, because data typing of SIMD floating-point and integer data types is not enforced at the architectural level, it is the responsibility of the programmer, assembler, or compiler to ensure that code enforces data typing. Failure to enforce correct data typing can lead to computations that return unexpected results.

For example, in the following code sample, two packed single precision floating-point operands are moved from memory into XMM registers (using MOVAPS instructions); then a double precision packed add operation (using the ADDPD instruction) is performed on the operands:

```
movaps      xmm0, [eax] ; EAX register contains pointer to packed
                    ; single precision floating-point operand

movaps      xmm1, [ebx]

addpd       xmm0, xmm1
```

Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors execute these instructions without generating an invalid-operand exception (#UD) and will produce the expected results in register XMM0 (that is, the high and low 64-bits of each register will be treated as a double precision floating-point value and the processor will operate on them accordingly). Because the data types operated on and the data type expected by the ADDPD instruction were inconsistent, the instruction may result in a SIMD floating-point exception (such as numeric overflow [#O] or invalid operation [#I]) being generated, but the actual source of the problem (inconsistent data types) is not detected.

The ability to operate on an operand that contains a data type that is inconsistent with the typing of the instruction being executed, permits some valid operations to be performed. For example, the following instructions load a packed double precision floating-point operand from memory to register XMM0, and a mask to register XMM1; then they use XORPD to toggle the sign bits of the two packed values in register XMM0.

```
movapd      xmm0, [eax] ; EAX register contains pointer to packed
                        ; double precision floating-point operand
movaps      xmm1, [ebx] ; EBX register contains pointer to packed
                        ; double precision floating-point mask
xorpd       xmm0, xmm1 ; XOR operation toggles sign bits using
                        ; the mask in xmm1
```

In this example: XORPS or PXOR can be used in place of XORPD and yield the same correct result. However, because of the type mismatch between the operand data type and the instruction data type, a latency penalty will be incurred due to implementations of the instructions at the microarchitecture level.

Latency penalties can also be incurred by using move instructions of the wrong type. For example, MOVAPS and MOVAPD can both be used to move a packed single precision operand from memory to an XMM register. However, if MOVAPD is used, a latency penalty will be incurred when a correctly typed instruction attempts to use the data in the register.

Note that these latency penalties are not incurred when moving data from XMM registers to memory.

## 11.6.10 Interfacing with Intel® SSE and SSE2 Procedures and Functions

Intel SSE and SSE2 allow direct access to XMM registers. This means that all existing interface conventions between procedures and functions that apply to the use of the general-purpose registers (EAX, EBX, etc.) also apply to XMM register usage.

### 11.6.10.1 Passing Parameters in XMM Registers

The state of XMM registers is preserved across procedure (or function) boundaries. Parameters can be passed from one procedure to another using XMM registers.

### 11.6.10.2 Saving XMM Register State on a Procedure or Function Call

The state of XMM registers can be saved in two ways: using an FXSAVE instruction or a move instruction. FXSAVE saves the state of all XMM registers (along with the state of MXCSR and the x87 FPU registers). This instruction is typically used for major changes in the context of the execution environment, such as a task switch. FXRSTOR restores the XMM, MXCSR, and x87 FPU registers stored with FXSAVE.

In cases where only XMM registers must be saved, or where selected XMM registers need to be saved, move instructions (MOVAPS, MOVUPS, MOVSS, MOVAPD, MOVUPD, MOVSD, MOVDQA, and MOVDQU) can be used. These instructions can also be used to restore the contents of XMM registers. To avoid performance degradation when saving XMM registers to memory or when loading XMM registers from memory, be sure to use the appropriately typed move instructions.

The move instructions can also be used to save the contents of XMM registers on the stack. Here, the stack pointer (in the ESP register) can be used as the memory address to the next available byte in the stack. Note that the stack pointer is not automatically incremented when using a move instruction (as it is with PUSH).

A move-instruction procedure that saves the contents of an XMM register to the stack is responsible for decrementing the value in the ESP register by 16. Likewise, a move-instruction procedure that loads an XMM register from the stack needs also to increment the ESP register by 16. To avoid performance degradation when moving the contents of XMM registers, use the appropriately typed move instructions.

Use the LDMXCSR and STMXCSR instructions to save and restore, respectively, the contents of the MXCSR register on a procedure call and return.

### 11.6.10.3 Caller-Save Recommendation for Procedure and Function Calls

When making procedure (or function) calls from SSE or SSE2 code, a caller-save convention is recommended for saving the state of the calling procedure. Using this convention, any register whose content must survive intact across a procedure call must be stored in memory by the calling procedure prior to executing the call.

The primary reason for using the caller-save convention is to prevent performance degradation. XMM registers can contain packed or scalar double precision floating-point, packed single precision floating-point, and 128-bit packed integer data types. The called procedure has no way of knowing the data types in XMM registers following a call; so it is unlikely to use the correctly typed move instruction to store the contents of XMM registers in memory or to restore the contents of XMM registers from memory.

As described in Section 11.6.9, “Mixing Packed and Scalar Floating-Point and 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions and Data,” executing a move instruction that does not match the type for the data being moved to/from XMM registers will be carried out correctly, but can lead to a greater instruction latency.

### 11.6.11 Updating Existing MMX Technology Routines Using 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions

Intel SSE2 extends all 64-bit MMX SIMD integer instructions to operate on 128-bit SIMD integers using XMM registers. The extended 128-bit SIMD integer instructions operate like the 64-bit SIMD integer instructions; this simplifies the porting of MMX technology applications. However, there are considerations:

- To take advantage of wider 128-bit SIMD integer instructions, MMX technology code must be recompiled to reference the XMM registers instead of MMX registers.
- Computation instructions that reference memory operands that are not aligned on 16-byte boundaries should be replaced with an unaligned 128-bit load (MOVUDQ instruction) followed by a version of the same computation operation that uses register instead of memory operands. Use of 128-bit packed integer computation instructions with memory operands that are not 16-byte aligned results in a general protection exception (#GP).
- Extension of the PSHUFW instruction (shuffle word across 64-bit integer operand) across a full 128-bit operand is emulated by a combination of the following instructions: PSHUFW, PSUFLW, and PSUFD.
- Use of the 64-bit shift by bit instructions (PSRLQ, PSLLQ) can be extended to 128 bits in either of two ways:
  - Use of PSRLQ and PSLLQ, along with masking logic operations.
  - Rewriting the code sequence to use PSRLDQ and PSLLDQ (shift double quadword operand by bytes)
- Loop counters need to be updated, since each 128-bit SIMD integer instruction operates on twice the amount of data as its 64-bit SIMD integer counterpart.

### 11.6.12 Branching on Arithmetic Operations

There are no condition codes in SSE or SSE2 states. A packed-data comparison instruction generates a mask which can then be transferred to an integer register. The following code sequence provides an example of how to perform a conditional branch, based on the result of an Intel SSE2 arithmetic operation.

```

cmppd      XMM0, XMM1      ; generates a mask in XMM0
movmskpd   EAX, XMM0      ; moves a 2 bit mask to eax
test       EAX, 0          ; compare with desired result
jne        BRANCH TARGET

```

The COMISD and UCOMISD instructions update the EFLAGS as the result of a scalar comparison. A conditional branch can then be scheduled immediately following COMISD/UCOMISD.

### 11.6.13 Cacheability Hint Instructions

Intel SSE and SSE2 cacheability control instructions enable the programmer to control prefetching, caching, loading, and storing of data. When correctly used, these instructions improve application performance.

To make efficient use of the processor's super-scalar microarchitecture, a program needs to provide a steady stream of data to the executing program to avoid stalling the processor. PREFETCH $h$  instructions minimize the latency of data accesses in performance-critical sections of application code by allowing data to be fetched into the processor cache hierarchy in advance of actual usage.

PREFETCH $h$  instructions do not change the user-visible semantics of a program, although they may affect performance. The operation of these instructions is implementation-dependent. Programmers may need to tune code for each IA-32 processor implementation. Excessive usage of PREFETCH $h$  instructions may waste memory bandwidth and reduce performance. For more detailed information on the use of prefetch hints, refer to Chapter 7, "Optimizing Cache Usage," in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.

The non-temporal store instructions (MOVNTI, MOVNTPD, MOVNTPS, MOVNTDQ, MOVNTQ, MASKMOVQ, and MASKMOVDQU) minimize cache pollution when writing non-temporal data to memory (see Section 10.4.6.1, "Cacheability Control Instructions," and Section 10.4.6.2, "Caching of Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data"). They prevent non-temporal data from being written into processor caches on a store operation.

Besides reducing cache pollution, the use of weakly-ordered memory types can be important under certain data sharing relationships, such as a producer-consumer relationship. The use of weakly ordered memory can make the assembling of data more efficient; but care must be taken to ensure that the consumer obtains the data that the producer intended. Some common usage models that may be affected in this way by weakly-ordered stores are:

- Library functions that use weakly ordered memory to write results.
- Compiler-generated code that writes weakly-ordered results.
- Hand-crafted code.

The degree to which a consumer of data knows that the data is weakly ordered can vary for these cases. As a result, the SFENCE or MFENCE instruction should be used to ensure ordering between routines that produce weakly-ordered data and routines that consume the data. SFENCE and MFENCE provide a performance-efficient way to ensure ordering by guaranteeing that every store instruction that precedes SFENCE/MFENCE in program order is globally visible before a store instruction that follows the fence.

### 11.6.14 Effect of Instruction Prefixes on Intel® SSE and SSE2 Instructions

Table 11-3 describes the effects of instruction prefixes on Intel SSE and SSE2 instructions. (Table 11-3 also applies to SIMD integer and SIMD floating-point instructions in Intel SSE3.) Unpredictable behavior can range from prefixes being treated as a reserved operation on one generation of IA-32 processors to generating an invalid opcode exception on another generation of processors.

See also "Instruction Prefixes" in Chapter 2 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for complete description of instruction prefixes.

#### NOTE

Some Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instructions have two-byte opcodes that are either 2 bytes or 3 bytes in length. Two-byte opcodes that are 3 bytes in length consist of: a mandatory prefix (F2H, F3H, or 66H), 0FH, and an opcode byte. See Table 11-3.
