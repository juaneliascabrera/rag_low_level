## PROGRAMMING WITH INTEL® AVX, FMA, AND INTEL® AVX2

---

Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions (Intel® AVX) introduces 256-bit vector processing capability. The Intel AVX instruction set extends 128-bit SIMD instruction sets by employing a new instruction encoding scheme via a vector extension prefix (VEX). Intel AVX also offers several enhanced features beyond those available in prior generations of 128-bit SIMD extensions.

FMA (Fused Multiply Add) extensions enhances Intel AVX further in floating-point numeric computations. FMA provides high-throughput, arithmetic operations cover fused multiply-add, fused multiply-subtract, fused multiply add/subtract interleave, signed-reversed multiply on fused multiply-add and multiply-subtract.

Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX2) provides 256-bit integer SIMD extensions that accelerate computation across integer and floating-point domains using 256-bit vector registers.

This chapter summarizes the key features of Intel AVX, FMA, and Intel AVX2.

### 14.1 INTEL® AVX OVERVIEW

Intel AVX introduces the following architectural enhancements:

- Support for 256-bit wide vectors with the YMM vector register set.
- 256-bit floating-point instruction set enhancement with up to 2X performance gain relative to 128-bit Streaming SIMD extensions.
- Enhancement of legacy 128-bit SIMD instruction extensions to support three-operand syntax and to simplify compiler vectorization of high-level language expressions.
- VEX prefix-encoded instruction syntax support for generalized three-operand syntax to improve instruction programming flexibility and efficient encoding of new instruction extensions.
- Most VEX-encoded 128-bit and 256-bit AVX instructions (with both load and computational operation semantics) are not restricted to 16-byte or 32-byte memory alignment.
- Support flexible deployment of 256-bit AVX code, 128-bit AVX code, legacy 128-bit code and scalar code.

With the exception of SIMD instructions operating on MMX registers, almost all legacy 128-bit SIMD instructions have AVX equivalents that support three operand syntax. 256-bit AVX instructions employ three-operand syntax and some with 4-operand syntax.

#### 14.1.1 256-Bit Wide SIMD Register Support

Intel AVX introduces support for 256-bit wide SIMD registers (YMM0-YMM7 in operating modes that are 32-bit or less, YMM0-YMM15 in 64-bit mode). The lower 128-bits of the YMM registers are aliased to the respective 128-bit XMM registers.

Legacy SSE instructions (i.e., SIMD instructions operating on XMM state but not using the VEX prefix, also referred to non-VEX encoded SIMD instructions) will not access the upper bits beyond bit 128 of the YMM registers. AVX instructions with a VEX prefix and vector length of 128-bits zeroes the upper bits (above bit 128) of the YMM register.

The left section, labeled 'YMM0' and 'YMM1' (with an ellipsis and 'YMM15' at the bottom), spans from bit 255 down to bit 128. The right section, labeled 'XMM0' and 'XMM1' (with an ellipsis and 'XMM15' at the bottom), spans from bit 127 down to bit 0. The bit numbers 255, 128, 127, and 0 are indicated at the top. Dashed lines outline the boundaries of the YMM and XMM register sets.](5f1e4148c0eab59bf4f2254d117dd6d3_img.jpg)

### 14.1.2 Instruction Syntax Enhancements

Intel AVX employs an instruction encoding scheme using a new prefix (known as “VEX” prefix). Instruction encoding using the VEX prefix can directly encode a register operand within the VEX prefix. This support two new instruction syntax in Intel 64 architecture:

- A non-destructive operand (in a three-operand instruction syntax): The non-destructive source reduces the number of registers, register-register copies and explicit load operations required in typical SSE loops, reduces code size, and improves micro-fusion opportunities.
- A third source operand (in a four-operand instruction syntax) via the upper 4 bits in an 8-bit immediate field. Support for the third source operand is defined for selected instructions (e.g., VBLENDVPD, VBLENDVPS, PBLENDVB).

Two-operand instruction syntax previously expressed in legacy SSE instruction as

```
ADDPS xmm1, xmm2/m128
```

128-bit AVX equivalent can be expressed in three-operand syntax as

```
VADDPS xmm1, xmm2, xmm3/m128
```

In four-operand syntax, the extra register operand is encoded in the immediate byte.

Note SIMD instructions supporting three-operand syntax but processing only 128-bits of data are considered part of the 256-bit SIMD instruction set extensions of AVX, because bits 255:128 of the destination register are zeroed by the processor.

### 14.1.3 VEX Prefix Instruction Encoding Support

Intel AVX introduces a new prefix, referred to as VEX, in the Intel 64 and IA-32 instruction encoding format. Instruction encoding using the VEX prefix provides the following capabilities:

- Direct encoding of a register operand within VEX. This provides instruction syntax support for non-destructive source operand.
- Efficient encoding of instruction syntax operating on 128-bit and 256-bit register sets.

- **Compaction of REX prefix functionality:** The equivalent functionality of the REX prefix is encoded within VEX.
- **Compaction of SIMD prefix functionality and escape byte encoding:** The functionality of SIMD prefix (66H, F2H, F3H) on opcode is equivalent to an opcode extension field to introduce new processing primitives. This functionality is replaced by a more compact representation of opcode extension within the VEX prefix. Similarly, the functionality of the escape opcode byte (0FH) and two-byte escape (0F38H, 0F3AH) are also compacted within the VEX prefix encoding.
- **Most VEX-encoded SIMD numeric and data processing instruction semantics with memory operand have relaxed memory alignment requirements than instructions encoded using SIMD prefixes (see Section 14.9).**

VEX prefix encoding applies to SIMD instructions operating on YMM registers, XMM registers, and in some cases with a general-purpose register as one of the operand. VEX prefix is not supported for instructions operating on MMX or x87 registers. Details of VEX prefix and instruction encoding are discussed in Chapter 2, “Instruction Format,” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A.

## 14.2 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

Intel AVX provides comprehensive functional improvements over previous generations of SIMD instruction extensions. The functional improvements include:

- **256-bit floating-point arithmetic primitives:** Intel AVX enhances existing 128-bit floating-point arithmetic instructions with 256-bit capabilities for floating-point processing. Table 14-1 lists SIMD instructions promoted to Intel AVX.
- **Enhancements for flexible SIMD data movements:** Intel AVX provides a number of new data movement primitives to enable efficient SIMD programming in relation to loading non-unit-strided data into SIMD registers, intra-register SIMD data manipulation, conditional expression and branch handling, etc. Enhancements for SIMD data movement primitives cover 256-bit and 128-bit vector floating-point data, and across 128-bit integer SIMD data processing using VEX-encoded instructions.

Intel AVX introduces 18 data processing instructions that operate on 256-bit vectors, Table 14-4. These new primitives cover the following operations:

- Non-unit-strided fetching of SIMD data. Intel AVX provides several flexible SIMD floating-point data fetching primitives:
  - Broadcast of single or multiple data elements into a 256-bit destination.
  - Masked move primitives to load or store SIMD data elements conditionally.
- Intra-register manipulation of SIMD data elements. Intel AVX provides several flexible SIMD floating-point data manipulation primitives:
  - Insert/extract multiple SIMD floating-point data elements to/from 256-bit SIMD registers.
  - Permute primitives to facilitate efficient manipulation of floating-point data elements in 256-bit SIMD registers.
- Branch handling. Intel AVX provides several primitives to enable handling of branches in SIMD programming:
  - Variable blend instructions supports four-operand syntax with non-destructive source syntax. This is more flexible than the equivalent Intel SSE4 instruction syntax which uses the XMM0 register as the implied mask for blend selection.
  - Packed TEST instructions for floating-point data.

### 14.2.3 Arithmetic Primitives for 128-Bit Vector and Scalar processing

Intel AVX provides a full complement of 128-bit numeric processing instructions that employ VEX-prefix encoding. These VEX-encoded instructions generally provide the same functionality over instructions operating on XMM register that are encoded using SIMD prefixes. The 128-bit numeric processing instructions in AVX cover floating-point and integer data processing; across 128-bit vector and scalar processing. Table 14-5 lists the state of promotion of legacy SIMD arithmetic ISA to VEX-128 encoding. Legacy SIMD floating-point arithmetic ISA promoted to VEX-256 encoding also support VEX-128 encoding (see Table 14-2).

The enhancement in Intel AVX on 128-bit floating-point compare operation provides 32 conditional predicates to improve programming flexibility in evaluating conditional expressions. This contrasts with floating-point SIMD compare instructions in Intel SSE and SSE2 supporting only eight conditional predicates.

#### 14.2.4 Non-Arithmetic Primitives for 128-Bit Vector and Scalar Processing

Intel AVX provides a full complement of data processing instructions that employ VEX-prefix encoding. These VEX-encoded instructions generally provide the same functionality over instructions operating on XMM register that are encoded using SIMD prefixes.

A subset of new functionalities listed in Table 14-4 is also extended via VEX.128 encoding. These enhancements in AVX on 128-bit data processing primitives include 11 new instructions (see Table 14-6) with the following capabilities:

- Non-unit-strided fetching of SIMD data. AVX provides several flexible SIMD floating-point data fetching primitives:
  - broadcast of single data element into a 128-bit destination,
  - masked move primitives to load or store SIMD data elements conditionally,
- Intra-register manipulation of SIMD data elements. AVX provides several flexible SIMD floating-point data manipulation primitives:
  - permute primitives to facilitate efficient manipulation of floating-point data elements in 128-bit SIMD registers
- Branch handling. AVX provides several primitives to enable handling of branches in SIMD programming:
  - new variable blend instructions supports four-operand syntax with non-destructive source syntax. Branching conditions dependent on floating-point data or integer data can benefit from Intel AVX. This is more flexible than non-VEX encoded instruction syntax that uses the XMM0 register as implied mask for blend selection. While variable blend with implied XMM0 syntax is supported in SSE4 using SIMD prefix encoding, VEX-encoded 128-bit variable blend instructions only support the more flexible four-operand syntax.
  - Packed TEST instructions for floating-point data.

Description of column “Reason not promoted”:

- **MMX:** Instructions referencing MMX registers do not support VEX.
- **Scalar:** Scalar instructions are not promoted to 256-bit.
- **VI:** “Vector Integer” instructions are not promoted to 256-bit.
- **Note 1:** MOVLDP/PS and MOVHPD/PS are not promoted to 256-bit. The equivalent functionality are provided by VINSERTF128 and VEXTRACTF128 instructions as the existing instructions have no natural 256b extension
- **Note 3:** It is expected that using 128-bit INSERTPS followed by a VINSERTF128 would be better than promoting INSERTPS to 256-bit (for example).

## 14.3 DETECTION OF INTEL® AVX INSTRUCTIONS

Intel AVX instructions operate on the 256-bit YMM register state. Application detection of new instruction extensions operating on the YMM state follows the general procedural flow in Figure 14-2.

Prior to using Intel AVX, the application must identify that the operating system supports the XGETBV instruction, the YMM register state, in addition to processor’s support for YMM state management using XSAVE/XRSTOR and AVX instructions. The following simplified sequence accomplishes both and is strongly recommended.

- 1) Detect CPUID.01H:ECX.OSXSAVE[27] = 1 (XGETBV enabled for application use<sup>1</sup>).
- 2) Issue XGETBV and verify that XCR0[2:1] = ‘11b’ (XMM state and YMM state are enabled by OS).
- 3) detect CPUID.01H:ECX.AVX[28] = 1 (AVX instructions supported).

(Step 3 can be done in any order relative to 1 and 2.)

![Flowchart showing the general procedural flow of application detection of Intel AVX. The process starts with 'Check feature flag CPUID.1H:ECX.OSXSAVE = 1?'. If 'Yes', it leads to 'OS provides processor extended state management' and 'Implied HW support for XSAVE, XRSTOR, XGETBV, XCR0'. This then leads to 'Check enabled state in XCR0 via XGETBV'. If 'State enabled', it leads to 'Check feature flag for Instruction set', which finally leads to 'ok to use Instructions'.](3dc410a5ebf3b0c89bf330b989e2bccc_img.jpg)

**Figure 14-2. General Procedural Flow of Application Detection of Intel® AVX**

1. If CPUID.01H:ECX.OSXSAVE reports 1, it also indirectly implies the processor supports XSAVE, XRSTOR, XGETBV, processor extended state bit vector XCR0. Thus an application may streamline the checking of CPUID feature flags for XSAVE and OSXSAVE. XSETBV is a privileged instruction.

The following pseudocode illustrates this recommended application Intel AVX detection process:

**Example 14-1. Detection of Intel® AVX Instruction**

```

INT supports_AVX()
{
    mov     eax, 1
    cpuid
    and     ecx, 018000000H
    cmp     ecx, 018000000H; check both OSXSAVE and AVX feature flags
    jne     not_supported
    ; processor supports AVX instructions and XGETBV is enabled by OS
    mov     ecx, 0; specify 0 for XCRO register
    XGETBV     ; result in EDX:EAX
    and     eax, 06H
    cmp     eax, 06H; check OS has enabled both XMM and YMM state support
    jne     not_supported
    mov     eax, 1
    jmp     done
NOT_SUPPORTED:
    mov     eax, 0
done:
}

```

**NOTE**

It is unwise for an application to rely exclusively on CPUID.01H:ECX.AVX[28] or at all on CPUID.01H:ECX.XSAVE[26]: These indicate hardware support but not operating system support. If YMM state management is not enabled by an operating systems, Intel AVX instructions will #UD regardless of CPUID.01H:ECX.AVX[28]. "CPUID.01H:ECX.XSAVE[26] = 1" does not guarantee the OS actually uses the XSAVE process for state management.

These steps above also apply to enhanced 128-bit SIMD floating-pointing instructions in Intel AVX (using VEX prefix-encoding) that operate on the YMM states.

### 14.3.1 Detection of VEX-Encoded AES and VPCLMULQDQ

The VAESDEC/VAESDECLAST/VAESEC/VAESENCLAST/VAESIMC/VAESKEYGENASSIST instructions operate on YMM states. The detection sequence must combine checking for CPUID.01H:ECX.AES[25] = 1 and the sequence for detection application support for Intel AVX.

#### Example 14-2. Detection of VEX-Encoded Intel® AES-NI Instructions

```

INT supports_VAESNI()
{
    mov     eax, 1
    cpuid
    and     ecx, 01A000000H
    cmp     ecx, 01A000000H; check OSXSAVE AVX and AESNI feature flags
    jne     not_supported
    ; processor supports AVX and VEX-encoded AESNI and XGETBV is enabled by OS
    mov     ecx, 0; specify 0 for XCRO register
    XGETBV     ; result in EDX:EAX
    and     eax, 06H
    cmp     eax, 06H; check OS has enabled both XMM and YMM state support
    jne     not_supported
    mov     eax, 1
    jmp     done
NOT_SUPPORTED:
    mov     eax, 0
done:

```

Similarly, the detection sequence for VPCLMULQDQ must combine checking for CPUID.01H:ECX.PCLMULQDQ[1] = 1 and the sequence for detection application support for Intel AVX.

This is shown in the pseudocode provided in Example 14-3.

#### Example 14-3. Detection of VEX-Encoded Intel® AES-NI Instructions

```

INT supports_VPCLMULQDQ()
{
    mov     eax, 1
    cpuid
    and     ecx, 018000002H
    cmp     ecx, 018000002H; check OSXSAVE AVX and PCLMULQDQ feature flags
    jne     not_supported
    ; processor supports AVX and VEX-encoded PCLMULQDQ and XGETBV is enabled by OS
    mov     ecx, 0; specify 0 for XCRO register
    XGETBV     ; result in EDX:EAX
    and     eax, 06H
    cmp     eax, 06H; check OS has enabled both XMM and YMM state support
    jne     not_supported

    mov     eax, 1
    jmp     done
NOT_SUPPORTED:
    mov     eax, 0
done:

```

### 14.4 HALF PRECISION FLOATING-POINT CONVERSION

VCVTPH2PS and VCVTPS2PH are two instructions supporting half precision floating-point data type conversion to and from single precision floating-point data types.

Half precision floating-point values are not used by the processor directly for arithmetic operations. But the conversion operation are subject to SIMD floating-point exceptions.

Additionally, the conversion operations of VCVTPS2PH allow programmer to specify rounding control using control fields in an immediate byte. The effects of the immediate byte are listed in Table 14-8.

Rounding control can use Imm[2] to select an override RC field specified in Imm[1:0] or use MXCSR setting.

Table 14-8. Immediate Byte Encoding for 16-Bit Floating-Point Conversion Instructions

| Bits     | Field Name/value | Description               | Comment         |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Imm[1:0] | RC=00B           | Round to nearest even     | If Imm[2] = 0   |
|          | RC=01B           | Round down                |                 |
|          | RC=10B           | Round up                  |                 |
|          | RC=11B           | Truncate                  |                 |
| Imm[2]   | MS1=0            | Use imm[1:0] for rounding | Ignore MXCSR.RC |
|          | MS1=1            | Use MXCSR.RC for rounding |                 |
| Imm[7:3] | Ignored          | Ignored by processor      |                 |

Specific SIMD floating-point exceptions that can occur in conversion operations are shown in Table 14-9 and Table 14-10.

Table 14-9. Non-Numerical Behavior for VCVTPH2PS and VCVTPS2PH

| Source Operands | Masked Result      | Unmasked Result                       |
|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| QNaN            | QNaN1 <sup>1</sup> | QNaN1 <sup>1</sup> (not an exception) |
| SNaN            | QNaN1 <sup>2</sup> | None                                  |

NOTES:

- 1. The half precision output QNaN1 is created from the single precision input QNaN as follows: the sign bit is preserved, the 8-bit exponent FFH is replaced by the 5-bit exponent 1FH, and the 24-bit significand is truncated to an 11-bit significand by removing its 14 least significant bits.
- 2. The half precision output QNaN1 is created from the single precision input SNaN as follows: the sign bit is preserved, the 8-bit exponent FFH is replaced by the 5-bit exponent 1FH, and the 24-bit significand is truncated to an 11-bit significand by removing its 14 least significant bits. The second most significant bit of the significand is changed from 0 to 1 to convert the signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.

Table 14-10. Invalid Operation for VCVTPH2PS and VCVTPS2PH

| Instruction | Condition | Masked Result  | Unmasked Result |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| VCVTPH2PS   | SRC = NaN | See Table 14-9 | #I=1            |
| VCVTPS2PH   | SRC = NaN | See Table 14-9 | #I=1            |

The VCVTPS2PH instruction can cause denormal exceptions if the value of the source operand is denormal relative to the numerical range represented by the source format (see Table 14-11).

**Table 14-11. Denormal Condition Summary**

| Instruction | Condition                                | Masked Result                                                                                                                                                 | Unmasked Result        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| VCVTPH2PS   | SRC is denormal relative to input format | res = Result rounded to the destination precision and using the bounded exponent, but only if no unmasked post-computation exception occurs.<br>#DE unchanged | Same as masked result. |
| VCVTPS2PH   | SRC is denormal relative to input format | res = Result rounded to the destination precision and using the bounded exponent, but only if no unmasked post-computation exception occurs.<br>#DE=1         | #DE=1                  |

The VCVTPS2PH instruction can cause an underflow exception if the result of the conversion is less than the underflow threshold for half precision floating-point data type, i.e.,  $|x| < 1.0 * 2^{-14}$ .

**Table 14-12. Underflow Condition for VCVTPS2PH**

| Instruction | Condition                                                               | Masked Result <sup>1</sup>                                                            | Unmasked Result                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| VCVTPS2PH   | Result < smallest destination precision final normal value <sup>2</sup> | Result = +0 or -0, denormal, normal.<br>#UE = 1.<br>#PE = 1 if the result is inexact. | #UE=1,<br>#PE = 1 if the result is inexact. |

**NOTES:**

1. Masked and unmasked results are shown in Table 14-11.
2. MXCSR.FTZ is ignored, the processor behaves as if MXCSR.FTZ = 0.

The VCVTPS2PH instruction can cause an overflow exception if the result of the conversion is greater than the maximum representable value for half precision floating-point data type, i.e.,  $|x| \geq 1.0 * 2^{16}$ .

**Table 14-13. Overflow Condition for VCVTPS2PH**

| Instruction | Condition                                                                   | Masked Result                    | Unmasked Result |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| VCVTPS2PH   | Result $\geq$ largest destination precision final normal value <sup>1</sup> | Result = +Inf or -Inf.<br>#OE=1. | #OE=1.          |

The VCVTPS2PH instruction can cause an inexact exception if the result of the conversion is not exactly representable in the destination format.

**Table 14-14. Inexact Condition for VCVTPS2PH**

| Instruction | Condition                                                 | Masked Result <sup>1</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Unmasked Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| VCVTPS2PH   | The result is not representable in the destination format | res = Result rounded to the destination precision and using the bounded exponent, but only if no unmasked underflow or overflow conditions occur (this exception can occur in the presence of a masked underflow or overflow).<br>#PE=1. | Only if no underflow/overflow condition occurred, or if the corresponding exceptions are masked: <ul style="list-style-type: none"> <li>▪ Set #OE if masked overflow and set result as described above for masked overflow.</li> <li>▪ Set #UE if masked underflow and set result as described above for masked underflow.</li> </ul> If neither underflow nor overflow, result equals the result rounded to the destination precision and using the bounded exponent set #PE = 1. |

**NOTES:**

1. If a source is denormal relative to input format with DM masked and at least one of PM or UM unmasked, then an exception will be raised with DE, UE, and PE set.

### 14.4.1 Detection of F16C Instructions

Applications using float 16 instruction must follow a detection sequence similar to Intel AVX to ensure:

- The OS has enabled YMM state management support.
- The processor supports Intel AVX as indicated by the CPUID feature flag, i.e., CPUID.01H:ECX.AVX[28] = 1.
- The processor supports 16-bit floating-point conversion instructions via a CPUID feature flag (CPUID.01H:ECX.F16C[29] = 1).

Application detection of Float-16 conversion instructions follow the general procedural flow in Figure 14-3.

![Flowchart showing the general procedural flow of application detection of Float-16 instructions. The process starts with 'Check feature flag CPUID.01H:ECX.OSXSAVE = 1?'. If 'Yes', it leads to 'Check enabled YMM state in XCR0 via XGETBV'. This step is annotated with 'OS provides processor extended state management' and 'Implied HW support for XSAVE, XRSTOR, XGETBV, XCR0'. If 'State enabled', it proceeds to 'Check feature flags for AVX and F16C', which finally leads to 'ok to use Instructions'.](731054eef74a5cc37ec33720571eab10_img.jpg)

## 14.5 FUSED-MULTIPLY-ADD (FMA) EXTENSIONS

FMA extensions enhances Intel AVX with high-throughput, arithmetic capabilities covering fused multiply-add, fused multiply-subtract, fused multiply add/subtract interleave, signed-reversed multiply on fused multiply-add and multiply-subtract. FMA extensions provide 36 256-bit floating-point instructions to perform computation on 256-bit vectors and additional 128-bit and scalar FMA instructions.

FMA extensions also provide 60 128-bit floating-point instructions to process 128-bit vector and scalar data. The arithmetic operations cover fused multiply-add, fused multiply-subtract, signed-reversed multiply on fused multiply-add and multiply-subtract.

### 14.5.1 FMA Instruction Operand Order and Arithmetic Behavior

FMA instruction mnemonics are defined explicitly with an ordered three digits, e.g., VFMADD132PD. The value of each digit refers to the ordering of the three source operand as defined by instruction encoding specification:

- '1': The first source operand (also the destination operand) in the syntactical order listed in this specification.
- '2': The second source operand in the syntactical order. This is a YMM/XMM register, encoded using VEX prefix.
- '3': The third source operand in the syntactical order. The first and third operand are encoded following ModR/M encoding rules.

The ordering of each digit within the mnemonic refers to the floating-point data listed on the right-hand side of the arithmetic equation of each FMA operation (see Table 14-17):

- The first position in the three digits of a FMA mnemonic refers to the operand position of the first FP data expressed in the arithmetic equation of FMA operation, the multiplicand.
- The second position in the three digits of a FMA mnemonic refers to the operand position of the second FP data expressed in the arithmetic equation of FMA operation, the multiplier.
- The third position in the three digits of a FMA mnemonic refers to the operand position of the FP data being added/subtracted to the multiplication result.

Note the non-numerical result of an FMA operation does not resemble the mathematically-defined commutative property between the multiplicand and the multiplier values (see Table 14-17). Consequently, software tools (such as an assembler) may support a complementary set of FMA mnemonics for each FMA instruction for ease of programming to take advantage of the mathematical property of commutative multiplications. For example, an assembler may optionally support the complementary mnemonic "VFMADD312PD" in addition to the true mnemonic "VFMADD132PD". The assembler will generate the same instruction opcode sequence corresponding to VFMADD132PD. The processor executes VFMADD132PD and report any NAN conditions based on the definition of VFMADD132PD. Similarly, if the complementary mnemonic VFMADD123PD is supported by an assembler at source level, it must generate the opcode sequence corresponding to VFMADD213PD; the complementary mnemonic VFMADD321PD must produce the opcode sequence defined by VFMADD231PD. In the absence of FMA operations reporting a NAN result, the numerical results of using either mnemonic with an assembler supporting both mnemonics will match the behavior defined in Table 14-17. Support for the complementary FMA mnemonics by software tools is optional.

### 14.5.2 Fused-Multiply-ADD (FMA) Numeric Behavior

FMA instructions can perform fused-multiply-add operations (including fused-multiply-subtract, and other varieties) on packed and scalar data elements in the instruction operands. Separate FMA instructions are provided to handle different types of arithmetic operations on the three source operands.

FMA instruction syntax is defined using three source operands and the first source operand is updated based on the result of the arithmetic operations of the data elements of 128-bit or 256-bit operands, i.e., The first source operand is also the destination operand.

The arithmetic FMA operation performed in an FMA instruction takes one of several forms,  $r=(x*y)+z$ ,  $r=(x*y)-z$ ,  $r=-(x*y)+z$ , or  $r=-(x*y)-z$ . Packed FMA instructions can perform eight single precision FMA operations or four double precision FMA operations with 256-bit vectors.

Scalar FMA instructions only perform one arithmetic operation on the low order data element. The content of the rest of the data elements in the lower 128-bits of the destination operand is preserved. the upper 128bits of the destination operand are filled with zero.

An arithmetic FMA operation of the form,  $r=(x*y)+z$ , takes two IEEE-754-2008 single (double) precision values and multiplies them to form an infinite precision intermediate value. This intermediate value is added to a third single (double) precision value (also at infinite precision) and rounded to produce a single (double) precision result.

Table 14-17 describes the numerical behavior of the FMA operation,  $r=(x*y)+z$ ,  $r=(x*y)-z$ ,  $r=-(x*y)+z$ ,  $r=-(x*y)-z$  for various input values. The input values can be 0, finite non-zero (F in Table 14-17), infinity of either sign (INF in Table 14-17), positive infinity (+INF in Table 14-17), negative infinity (-INF in Table 14-17), or NaN (including QNaN or SNaN). If any one of the input values is a NaN, the result of FMA operation,  $r$ , may be a quietized NaN. The result can be either  $Q(x)$ ,  $Q(y)$ , or  $Q(z)$ , see Table 14-17. If  $x$  is a NaN, then:

- $Q(x) = x$  if  $x$  is QNaN, or
- $Q(x) =$  the quietized NaN obtained from  $x$  if  $x$  is SNaN.

The notation for the output value in Table 14-17 are:

- “+INF”: positive infinity, “-INF”: negative infinity. When the result depends on a conditional expression, both values are listed in the result column and the condition is described in the comment column.
- QNaNIndefinite represents the QNaN which has the sign bit equal to 1, the most significand field equal to 1, and the remaining significand field bits equal to 0.
- The summation or subtraction of 0s or identical values in FMA operation can lead to the following situations shown in Table 14-16.
- If the FMA computation represents an invalid operation (e.g., when adding two INF with opposite signs), the invalid exception is signaled, and the MXCSR.IE flag is set.

If unmasked floating-point exceptions are signaled (invalid operation, denormal operand, overflow, underflow, or inexact result) the result register is left unchanged and a floating-point exception handler is invoked.

### 14.5.3 Detection of FMA

Hardware support for FMA is indicated by CPUID.01H:ECX.FMA[12]=1.

Application Software must identify that hardware supports AVX, after that it must also detect support for FMA by CPUID.01H:ECX.FMA[12]. The recommended pseudocode sequence for detection of FMA is:

```

INT supports_fma()
{
    ; result in eax
    mov eax, 1
    cpuid
    and ecx, 018001000H
    cmp ecx, 018001000H; check OSXSAVE, AVX, FMA feature flags
    jne not_supported
    ; processor supports AVX,FMA instructions and XGETBV is enabled by OS
    mov ecx, 0; specify 0 for XCR0 register
    XGETBV; result in EDX:EAX
    and eax, 06H
    cmp eax, 06H; check OS has enabled both XMM and YMM state support
    jne not_supported
    mov eax, 1
    jmp done
NOT_SUPPORTED:
    mov eax, 0
done:
}

```

Note that FMA comprises 256-bit and 128-bit SIMD instructions operating on YMM states.

## 14.6 OVERVIEW OF INTEL® ADVANCED VECTOR EXTENSIONS 2 (INTEL® AVX2)

Intel® AVX2 extends Intel AVX by promoting most of the 128-bit SIMD integer instructions with 256-bit numeric processing capabilities. Intel AVX2 instructions follow the same programming model as AVX instructions.

In addition, Intel AVX2 provide enhanced functionalities for broadcast/permute operations on data elements, vector shift instructions with variable-shift count per data element, and instructions to fetch non-contiguous data elements from memory.

### 14.6.1 Intel® AVX2 and 256-Bit Vector Integer Processing

Intel AVX2 promotes the vast majority of 128-bit integer SIMD instruction sets to operate with 256-bit wide YMM registers. Intel AVX2 instructions are encoded using the VEX prefix and require the same operating system support as Intel AVX. Generally, most of the promoted 256-bit vector integer instructions follow the 128-bit lane operation, similar to the promoted 256-bit floating-point SIMD instructions in Intel AVX.

Newer functionalities in Intel AVX2 generally fall into the following categories:

- Fetching non-contiguous data elements from memory using vector-index memory addressing. These “gather” instructions introduce a new memory-addressing form, consisting of a base register and multiple indices specified by a vector register (either XMM or YMM). Data elements sizes of 32 and 64-bits are supported, and data types for floating-point and integer elements are also supported.
- Cross-lane functionalities are provided with several new instructions for broadcast and permute operations. Some of the 256-bit vector integer instructions promoted from legacy SSE instruction sets also exhibit cross-lane behavior, e.g., VPMOVB/VPMOVS family.
- Intel AVX2 complements the Intel AVX instructions that are typed for floating-point operation with a full complement of equivalent set for operating with 32/64-bit integer data elements.
- Vector shift instructions with per-element shift count. Data elements sizes of 32 and 64 bits are supported.

## 14.7 PROMOTED VECTOR INTEGER INSTRUCTIONS IN INTEL® AVX2

In Intel AVX2, most SSSE3 and Intel SSE, SSE2, SSE3, and SSE4 vector integer instructions have been promoted to support VEX.256 encodings. Table 14-18 summarizes the promotion status for existing instructions. The column “VEX.128” indicates whether the instruction using VEX.128 prefix encoding is supported.

The column “VEX.256” indicates whether 256-bit vector form of the instruction using the VEX.256 prefix encoding is supported, and under which feature flag.

### 14.7.1 Detection of Intel® AVX2

Hardware support for Intel AVX2 is indicated by CPUID.07H.00H:EBX.AVX2[5] = 1.

Application Software must identify that hardware supports Intel AVX, after that it must also detect support for Intel AVX2 by checking CPUID.07H.00H:EBX.AVX2[5]. The recommended pseudocode sequence for detection of Intel AVX2 is:

```

-----
INT supports_avx2()
{
    ; result in eax
    mov eax, 1
    cpuid
    and ecx, 018000000H
    cmp ecx, 018000000H; check both OSXSAVE and AVX feature flags
    jne not_supported
    ; processor supports AVX instructions and XGETBV is enabled by OS
    mov eax, 7

```

```

    mov ecx, 0
    cpuid
    and ebx, 20H
    cmp ebx, 20H; check AVX2 feature flags
    jne not_supported
    mov ecx, 0; specify 0 for XCR0 register
    XGETBV; result in EDX:EAX
    and eax, 06H
    cmp eax, 06H; check OS has enabled both XMM and YMM state support
    jne not_supported
    mov eax, 1
    jmp done
NOT_SUPPORTED:
    mov eax, 0
done:
}

```

## 14.8 ACCESSING YMM REGISTERS

The lower 128 bits of a YMM register is aliased to the corresponding XMM register. Legacy SSE instructions (i.e., SIMD instructions operating on XMM state but not using the VEX prefix, also referred to non-VEX encoded SIMD instructions) will not access the upper bits (255:128) of the YMM registers. AVX and FMA instructions with a VEX prefix and vector length of 128-bits zeroes the upper 128 bits of the YMM register.

Upper bits of YMM registers (255:128) can be read and written by many instructions with a VEX.256 prefix.

XSAVE and XRSTOR may be used to save and restore the upper bits of the YMM registers.

## 14.9 MEMORY ALIGNMENT

Memory alignment requirements on VEX-encoded instruction differs from non-VEX-encoded instructions. Memory alignment applies to non-VEX-encoded SIMD instructions in three categories:

- Explicitly-aligned SIMD load and store instructions accessing 16 bytes of memory (e.g., MOVAPD, MOVAPS, MOVDQA, etc.). These instructions always require memory address to be aligned on 16-byte boundary.
- Explicitly-unaligned SIMD load and store instructions accessing 16 bytes or less of data from memory (e.g., MOVUPD, MOVUPS, MOVDQU, MOVQ, MOVD, etc.). These instructions do not require memory address to be aligned on 16-byte boundary.
- The vast majority of arithmetic and data processing instructions in legacy SSE instructions (non-VEX-encoded SIMD instructions) support memory access semantics. When these instructions access 16 bytes of data from memory, the memory address must be aligned on 16-byte boundary.

Most arithmetic and data processing instructions encoded using the VEX prefix and performing memory accesses have more flexible memory alignment requirements than instructions that are encoded without the VEX prefix. Specifically,

- With the exception of explicitly aligned 16 or 32 byte SIMD load/store instructions, most VEX-encoded, arithmetic and data processing instructions operate in a flexible environment regarding memory address alignment, i.e., VEX-encoded instruction with 32-byte or 16-byte load semantics will support unaligned load operation by default. Memory arguments for most instructions with VEX prefix operate normally without

causing #GP(0) on any byte-granularity alignment (unlike Legacy SSE instructions). The instructions that require explicit memory alignment requirements are listed in Table 14-22.

Software may see performance penalties when unaligned accesses cross cacheline boundaries, so reasonable attempts to align commonly used data sets should continue to be pursued.

Atomic memory operation in Intel 64 and IA-32 architecture is guaranteed only for a subset of memory operand sizes and alignment scenarios. The list of guaranteed atomic operations are described in Section 11.1.1 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A. Intel AVX and FMA instructions do not introduce any new guaranteed atomic memory operations.

Intel AVX instructions can generate an #AC(0) fault on misaligned 4 or 8-byte memory references in Ring-3 when CR0.AM= 1. 16 and 32-byte memory references will not generate #AC(0) fault. See Table 14-21 for details.

Certain Intel AVX instructions always require 16- or 32-byte alignment (see the complete list of such instructions in Table 14-22). These instructions will #GP(0) if not aligned to 16-byte boundaries (for 16-byte granularity loads and stores) or 32-byte boundaries (for 32-byte loads and stores).

## 14.10 SIMD FLOATING-POINT EXCEPTIONS

Intel AVX instructions can generate SIMD floating-point exceptions (#XM) and respond to exception masks in the same way as Legacy SSE instructions. When CR4.OSXMMEXCPT=0 any unmasked FP exceptions generate an Undefined Opcode exception (#UD).

Intel AVX FP exceptions are created in a similar fashion (differing only in number of elements) to Legacy SSE and SSE2 instructions capable of generating SIMD floating-point exceptions.

AVX introduces no new arithmetic operations (AVX floating-point are analogues of existing Legacy SSE instructions).

F16C, FMA instructions can generate SIMD floating-point exceptions (#XM). The requirements that apply to Intel AVX also apply to F16C and FMA.

The subset of Intel AVX2 instructions that operate on floating-point data do not generate #XM.

The detailed exception conditions for Intel AVX instructions and legacy SIMD instructions (excluding instructions that operate on MMX registers) are described in a number of exception class types, depending on the operand syntax and memory operation characteristics. The complete list of SIMD instruction exception class types are defined in Chapter 2, “Instruction Format,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A.

## 14.11 EMULATION

Setting the CR0.EMbit to 1 provides a technique to emulate Legacy SSE floating-point instruction sets in software. This technique is not supported with AVX instructions.

If an operating system wishes to emulate AVX instructions, set XCR0[2:1] to zero. This will cause AVX instructions to #UD. Emulation of F16C, AVX2, and FMA by operating system can be done similarly as with emulating AVX instructions.

## 14.12 WRITING INTEL® AVX FLOATING-POINT EXCEPTION HANDLERS

Intel AVX and FMA floating-point exceptions are handled in an entirely analogous way to Legacy SSE floating-point exceptions. To handle unmasked SIMD floating-point exceptions, the operating system or executive must provide an exception handler. The section titled “SSE and SSE2 SIMD Floating-Point Exceptions” in Chapter 11, “Program-

ming with Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2),” describes the SIMD floating-point exception classes and gives suggestions for writing an exception handler to handle them.

To indicate that the operating system provides a handler for SIMD floating-point exceptions (#XM), the CR4.OSXMMEXCPT flag (bit 10) must be set.

The guidelines for writing Intel AVX floating-point exception handlers also apply to F16C and FMA.

## 14.13 GENERAL PURPOSE INSTRUCTION SET ENHANCEMENTS

Enhancements in the general-purpose instruction set consist of several categories:

- A rich collection of instructions to manipulate integer data at bit-granularity. Most of the bit-manipulation instructions employ VEX-prefix encoding to support three-operand syntax with non-destructive source operands. Two of the bit-manipulating instructions (LZCNT, TZCNT) are not encoded using VEX. The VEX-encoded bit-manipulation instructions include: ANDN, BEXTR, BLSI, BLSMSK, BLSR, BZHI, PEXT, PDEP, SARX, SHLX, SHRX, and RORX.
- Enhanced integer multiply instruction (MULX) in conjunctions with some of the bit-manipulation instructions allow software to accelerate calculation of large integer numerics (wider than 128-bits).
- INVPCID instruction targets system software that manages processor context IDs.
