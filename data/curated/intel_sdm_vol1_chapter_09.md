## 9.1 OVERVIEW OF MMX TECHNOLOGY

MMX technology defines a simple and flexible SIMD execution model to handle 64-bit packed integer data. This model adds the following features to the IA-32 architecture, while maintaining backwards compatibility with all IA-32 applications and operating-system code:

- Eight new 64-bit data registers, called MMX registers.
- Three new packed data types:
  - 64-bit packed byte integers (signed and unsigned).
  - 64-bit packed word integers (signed and unsigned).
  - 64-bit packed doubleword integers (signed and unsigned).
- Instructions that support the new data types and to handle MMX state management.
- Extensions to the CPUID instruction.

MMX technology is accessible from all the IA32-architecture execution modes (protected mode, real address mode, and virtual 8086 mode). It does not add any new modes to the architecture.

The following sections of this chapter describe MMX technology's programming environment, including MMX register set, data types, and instruction set. Additional instructions that operate on MMX registers have been added to the IA-32 architecture by the SSE/SSE2 extensions.

For more information, see:

- Section 10.4.4, "Intel® SSE 64-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions," describes MMX instructions added to the IA-32 architecture with the SSE extensions.
- Section 11.4.2, "Intel® SSE2 64-Bit and 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions," describes MMX instructions added to the IA-32 architecture with SSE2 extensions.
- The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 2A, 2B, 2C, & 2D, gives detailed descriptions of MMX instructions.
- Chapter 15, "Intel® MMX™ Technology System Programming," in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3B, describes the manner in which MMX technology is integrated into the IA-32 system programming model.

## 9.2 THE MMX TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT

Figure 9-1 shows the execution environment for MMX technology. All MMX instructions operate on MMX registers, the general-purpose registers, and/or memory as follows:

- **MMX registers** — These eight registers (see Figure 9-1) are used to perform operations on 64-bit packed integer data. They are named MM0 through MM7.

![Diagram of the MMX Technology Execution Environment showing MMX and General-Purpose registers within an address space.](c9e2a114dcd84c4d10e4f411ab1288a8_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the MMX Technology Execution Environment. It features a large rectangular frame representing the system. Inside this frame, on the left side, are two smaller rectangles. The top rectangle is labeled "MMX Registers Eight 64-Bit". Below it is another rectangle labeled "General-Purpose Registers Eight 32-Bit". To the right of these registers is a vertical bar representing the "Address Space". The address space is bounded by "0" at the bottom and " $2^{32}-1$ " at the top.

**Figure 9-1. MMX Technology Execution Environment**

- **General-purpose registers** — The eight general-purpose registers (see Figure 3-5) are used with existing IA-32 addressing modes to address operands in memory. (MMX registers cannot be used to address memory). General-purpose registers are also used to hold operands for some MMX technology operations. They are EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI, and ESP.

### 9.2.1 MMX Technology in 64-Bit Mode and Compatibility Mode

In compatibility mode and 64-bit mode, MMX instructions function like they do in protected mode. Memory operands are specified using the ModR/M, SIB encoding described in Section 3.7.5.

### 9.2.2 MMX Registers

The MMX register set consists of eight 64-bit registers (see Figure 9-2), that are used to perform calculations on the MMX packed integer data types. Values in MMX registers have the same format as a 64-bit quantity in memory.

The MMX registers have two data access modes: 64-bit access mode and 32-bit access mode. The 64-bit access mode is used for:

- 64-bit memory accesses.
- 64-bit transfers between MMX registers.
- All pack, logical, and arithmetic instructions.
- Some unpack instructions.

The 32-bit access mode is used for:

- 32-bit memory accesses.
- 32-bit transfer between general-purpose registers and MMX registers.
- Some unpack instructions.

Although MMX registers are defined in the IA-32 architecture as separate registers, they are aliased to the registers in the FPU data register stack (R0 through R7).

See also Section 9.5, “Compatibility with x87 FPU Architecture.”

### 9.2.3 MMX Data Types

MMX technology introduced the following 64-bit data types to the IA-32 architecture (see Figure 9-3):

- 64-bit packed byte integers — eight packed bytes.
- 64-bit packed word integers — four packed words.
- 64-bit packed doubleword integers — two packed doublewords.

MMX instructions move 64-bit packed data types (packed bytes, packed words, or packed doublewords) and the quadword data type between MMX registers and memory or between MMX registers in 64-bit blocks. However, when performing arithmetic or logical operations on the packed data types, MMX instructions operate in parallel on the individual bytes, words, or doublewords contained in MMX registers; see Section 9.2.5, “Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) Execution Model.”

![Diagram illustrating the data types introduced with MMX technology: Packed Byte Integers (8 bytes), Packed Word Integers (4 words), and Packed Doubleword Integers (2 doublewords). Each is shown as a 64-bit block from bit 63 to 0.](e55bdf10fc47cb9991c6857c0b7a7ac6_img.jpg)

Figure 9-3. Data Types Introduced with the MMX Technology

### 9.2.4 Memory Data Formats

When stored in memory: bytes, words, and doublewords in the packed data types are stored in consecutive addresses. The least significant byte, word, or doubleword is stored at the lowest address and the most significant byte, word, or doubleword is stored at the high address. The ordering of bytes, words, or doublewords in memory is always little endian. That is, the bytes with the low addresses are less significant than the bytes with high addresses.

## 9.2.5 Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) Execution Model

MMX technology uses the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) technique for performing arithmetic and logical operations on bytes, words, or doublewords packed into MMX registers (see Figure 9-4). For example, the PADDQ instruction adds 4 signed word integers from one source operand to 4 signed word integers in a second source operand and stores 4 word integer results in a destination operand. This SIMD technique speeds up software performance by allowing the same operation to be carried out on multiple data elements in parallel. MMX technology supports parallel operations on byte, word, and doubleword data elements when contained in MMX registers.

The SIMD execution model supported in the MMX technology directly addresses the needs of modern media, communications, and graphics applications, which often use sophisticated algorithms that perform the same operations on a large number of small data types (bytes, words, and doublewords). For example, most audio data is represented in 16-bit (word) quantities. The MMX instructions can operate on 4 words simultaneously with one instruction. Video and graphics information is commonly represented as palletized 8-bit (byte) quantities. In Figure 9-4, one MMX instruction operates on 8 bytes simultaneously.

![Figure 9-4: SIMD Execution Model diagram showing parallel processing of 4 data elements from two sources through an operation to produce 4 results in a destination register.](095cb128d8f8cc689f28744e6d5d798d_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the SIMD execution model. It shows three horizontal rows: 'Source 1', 'Source 2', and 'Destination'. Source 1 contains four boxes labeled X3, X2, X1, and X0. Source 2 contains four boxes labeled Y3, Y2, Y1, and Y0. Below Source 2, there are four circles, each labeled 'OP'. Arrows point from each X box in Source 1 to its corresponding Y box in Source 2, and from each Y box to its corresponding 'OP' circle. From each 'OP' circle, an arrow points down to a box in the Destination row. The Destination row contains four boxes labeled 'X3 OP Y3', 'X2 OP Y2', 'X1 OP Y1', and 'X0 OP Y0'.

## 9.3 SATURATION AND WRAPAROUND MODES

When performing integer arithmetic, an operation may result in an out-of-range condition, where the true result cannot be represented in the destination format. For example, when performing arithmetic on signed word integers, positive overflow can occur when the true signed result is larger than 16 bits.

The MMX technology provides three ways of handling out-of-range conditions:

- **Wraparound arithmetic** — With wraparound arithmetic, a true out-of-range result is truncated (that is, the carry or overflow bit is ignored and only the least significant bits of the result are returned to the destination). Wraparound arithmetic is suitable for applications that control the range of operands to prevent out-of-range results. If the range of operands is not controlled, however, wraparound arithmetic can lead to large errors. For example, adding two large signed numbers can cause positive overflow and produce a negative result.
- **Signed saturation arithmetic** — With signed saturation arithmetic, out-of-range results are limited to the representable range of signed integers for the integer size being operated on (see Table 9-1). For example, if positive overflow occurs when operating on signed word integers, the result is “saturated” to 7FFFH, which is the largest positive integer that can be represented in 16 bits; if negative overflow occurs, the result is saturated to 8000H.
- **Unsigned saturation arithmetic** — With unsigned saturation arithmetic, out-of-range results are limited to the representable range of unsigned integers for the integer size. So, positive overflow when operating on unsigned byte integers results in FFH being returned and negative overflow results in 00H being returned.

**Table 9-1. Data Range Limits for Saturation**

| Data Type     | Lower Limit |         | Upper Limit |         |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
|               | Hexadecimal | Decimal | Hexadecimal | Decimal |
| Signed Byte   | 80H         | -128    | 7FH         | 127     |
| Signed Word   | 8000H       | -32,768 | 7FFFH       | 32,767  |
| Unsigned Byte | 00H         | 0       | FFH         | 255     |
| Unsigned Word | 0000H       | 0       | FFFFH       | 65,535  |

Saturation arithmetic provides an answer for many overflow situations. For example, in color calculations, saturation causes a color to remain pure black or pure white without allowing inversion. It also prevents wraparound artifacts from entering into computations when range checking of source operands is not used.

MMX instructions do not indicate overflow or underflow occurrence by generating exceptions or setting flags in the EFLAGS register.

## 9.4 MMX INSTRUCTIONS

The MMX instruction set consists of 47 instructions, grouped into the following categories:

- Data transfer
- Arithmetic
- Comparison
- Conversion
- Unpacking
- Logical
- Shift
- Empty MMX state instruction (EMMS)

Table 9-2 gives a summary of the instructions in the MMX instruction set. The following sections give a brief overview of the instructions within each group.

### NOTES

The MMX instructions described in this chapter are those instructions that are available in an IA-32 processor when `CPUID.01H:EDX.MMX[23] = 1`.

Section 10.4.4, “Intel® SSE 64-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions,” and Section 11.4.2, “Intel® SSE2 64-Bit and 128-Bit SIMD Integer Instructions,” list additional instructions included with the Intel SSE/SSE2 extensions that operate on MMX registers but are not considered part of the MMX instruction set.

### 9.4.1 Data Transfer Instructions

The MOVD (Move 32 Bits) instruction transfers 32 bits of packed data from memory to an MMX register and vice versa; or from a general-purpose register to an MMX register and vice versa.

The MOVQ (Move 64 Bits) instruction transfers 64 bits of packed data from memory to an MMX register and vice versa; or transfers data between MMX registers.

### 9.4.2 Arithmetic Instructions

The arithmetic instructions perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and multiply/add operations on packed data types.

The PADDB/PADDW/PADDD (add packed integers) instructions and the PSUBB/PSUBW/ PSUBD (subtract packed integers) instructions add or subtract the corresponding signed or unsigned data elements of the source and desti-

nation operands in wraparound mode. These instructions operate on packed byte, word, and doubleword data types.

The PADD SB/PADD SW (add packed signed integers with signed saturation) instructions and the PSUB SB/PSUB SW (subtract packed signed integers with signed saturation) instructions add or subtract the corresponding signed data elements of the source and destination operands and saturate the result to the limits of the signed data-type range. These instructions operate on packed byte and word data types.

The PADD UB/PADD UW (add packed unsigned integers with unsigned saturation) instructions and the PSUB UB/PSUB UW (subtract packed unsigned integers with unsigned saturation) instructions add or subtract the corresponding unsigned data elements of the source and destination operands and saturate the result to the limits of the unsigned data-type range. These instructions operate on packed byte and word data types.

The PMUL HW (multiply packed signed integers and store high result) and PMUL LW (multiply packed signed integers and store low result) instructions perform a signed multiply of the corresponding words of the source and destination operands and write the high-order or low-order 16 bits of each of the results, respectively, to the destination operand.

The PMADD WD (multiply and add packed integers) instruction computes the products of the corresponding signed words of the source and destination operands. The four intermediate 32-bit doubleword products are summed in pairs (high-order pair and low-order pair) to produce two 32-bit doubleword results.

### 9.4.3 Comparison Instructions

The PCMPEQB/PCMPEQW/PCMPEQD (compare packed data for equal) instructions and the PCMPGTB/PCMPGTW/PCMPGTD (compare packed signed integers for greater than) instructions compare the corresponding signed data elements (bytes, words, or doublewords) in the source and destination operands for equal to or greater than, respectively.

These instructions generate a mask of ones or zeros which are written to the destination operand. Logical operations can use the mask to select packed elements. This can be used to implement a packed conditional move operation without a branch or a set of branch instructions. No flags in the EFLAGS register are affected.

### 9.4.4 Conversion Instructions

The PACKSSWB (pack words into bytes with signed saturation) and PACKSSDW (pack doublewords into words with signed saturation) instructions convert signed words into signed bytes and signed doublewords into signed words, respectively, using signed saturation.

PACKUSWB (pack words into bytes with unsigned saturation) converts signed words into unsigned bytes, using unsigned saturation.

### 9.4.5 Unpack Instructions

The PUNPCKHBW/PUNPCKHWD/PUNPCKHDQ (unpack high-order data elements) instructions and the PUNPCKLBW/PUNPCKLWD/PUNPCKLDQ (unpack low-order data elements) instructions unpack bytes, words, or doublewords from the high- or low-order data elements of the source and destination operands and interleave them in the destination operand. By placing all 0s in the source operand, these instructions can be used to convert byte integers to word integers, word integers to doubleword integers, or doubleword integers to quadword integers.

### 9.4.6 Logical Instructions

PAND (bitwise logical AND), PANDN (bitwise logical AND NOT), POR (bitwise logical OR), and PXOR (bitwise logical exclusive OR) perform bitwise logical operations on the quadword source and destination operands.

## 9.4.7 Shift Instructions

The logical shift left, logical shift right and arithmetic shift right instructions shift each element by a specified number of bit positions.

The PSLLW/PSLLD/PSLLQ (shift packed data left logical) instructions and the PSRLW/PSRLD/PSRLQ (shift packed data right logical) instructions perform a logical left or right shift of the data elements and fill the empty high or low order bit positions with zeros. These instructions operate on packed words, doublewords, and quadwords.

The PSRAW/PSRAD (shift packed data right arithmetic) instructions perform an arithmetic right shift, copying the sign bit for each data element into empty bit positions on the upper end of each data element. This instruction operates on packed words and doublewords.

## 9.4.8 EMMS Instruction

The EMMS instruction empties the MMX state by setting the tags in x87 FPU tag word to 11B, indicating empty registers. This instruction must be executed at the end of an MMX routine before calling other routines that can execute floating-point instructions. See Section 9.6.3, “Using the EMMS Instruction,” for more information on the use of this instruction.

## 9.5 COMPATIBILITY WITH X87 FPU ARCHITECTURE

The MMX state is aliased to the x87 FPU state. No new states or modes have been added to IA-32 architecture to support the MMX technology. The same floating-point instructions that save and restore the x87 FPU state also handle the MMX state (for example, during context switching).

MMX technology uses the same interface techniques between the x87 FPU and the operating system (primarily for task switching purposes). For more details, see Chapter 15, “Intel® MMX™ Technology System Programming,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.

### 9.5.1 MMX Instructions and the x87 FPU Tag Word

After each MMX instruction, the entire x87 FPU tag word is set to valid (00B). The EMMS instruction (empty MMX state) sets the entire x87 FPU tag word to empty (11B).

Chapter 15, “Intel® MMX™ Technology System Programming,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, provides additional information about the effects of x87 FPU and MMX instructions on the x87 FPU tag word. For a description of the tag word, see Section 8.1.7, “x87 FPU Tag Word.”

## 9.6 WRITING APPLICATIONS WITH MMX CODE

The following sections give guidelines for writing application code that uses MMX technology.

### 9.6.1 Checking for MMX Technology Support

Before an application attempts to use the MMX technology, it should check that it is present on the processor. Check by following these steps:

1. Check that the processor supports the CPUID instruction by attempting to execute the CPUID instruction. If the processor does not support the CPUID instruction, this will generate an invalid-opcode exception (#UD).
2. Check that the processor supports the MMX technology (if CPUID.01H:EDX.MMX[23] = 1).
3. Check that emulation of the x87 FPU is disabled (if CR0.EM[bit 2] = 0).

If the processor attempts to execute an unsupported MMX instruction or attempts to execute an MMX instruction with CR0.EM[bit 2] set, this generates an invalid-opcode exception (#UD).

Example 9-1 illustrates how to use the CUID instruction to detect the MMX technology. This example does not represent the entire CUID sequence, but shows the portion used for detection of MMX technology.

#### Example 9-1. Partial Routine for Detecting MMX Technology with the CUID Instruction

```

...                ; identify existence of CUID instruction
...                ; identify Intel processor
mov    EAX, 1      ; request for feature flags
CUID   ; 0FH, 0A2H CUID instruction
test   EDX, 00800000H ; Is IA MMX technology bit (Bit 23 of EDX) set?
jnz    ; MMX_Technology_Found

```

### 9.6.2 Transitions Between x87 FPU and MMX Code

Applications can contain both x87 FPU floating-point and MMX instructions. However, because the MMX registers are aliased to the x87 FPU register stack, care must be taken when making transitions between x87 FPU instructions and MMX instructions to prevent incoherent or unexpected results.

When an MMX instruction (other than the EMMS instruction) is executed, the processor changes the x87 FPU state as follows:

- The TOS (top of stack) value of the x87 FPU status word is set to 0.
- The entire x87 FPU tag word is set to the valid state (00B in all tag fields).
- When an MMX instruction writes to an MMX register, it writes ones (11B) to the exponent part of the corresponding floating-point register (bits 64 through 79).

The net result of these actions is that any x87 FPU state prior to the execution of the MMX instruction is essentially lost.

When an x87 FPU instruction is executed, the processor assumes that the current state of the x87 FPU register stack and control registers is valid and executes the instruction without any preparatory modifications to the x87 FPU state.

If the application contains both x87 FPU floating-point and MMX instructions, the following guidelines are recommended:

- When transitioning between x87 FPU and MMX code, save the state of any x87 FPU data or control registers that need to be preserved for future use. The FSAVE and FXSAVE instructions save the entire x87 FPU state.
- When transitioning between MMX and x87 FPU code, do the following:
  - Save any data in the MMX registers that needs to be preserved for future use. FSAVE and FXSAVE also save the state of MMX registers.
  - Execute the EMMS instruction to clear the MMX state from the x87 data and control registers.

The following sections describe the use of the EMMS instruction and give additional guidelines for mixing x87 FPU and MMX code.

### 9.6.3 Using the EMMS Instruction

As described in Section 9.6.2, “Transitions Between x87 FPU and MMX Code,” when an MMX instruction executes, the x87 FPU tag word is marked valid (00B). In this state, the execution of subsequent x87 FPU instructions may produce unexpected x87 FPU floating-point exceptions and/or incorrect results because the x87 FPU register stack appears to contain valid data. The EMMS instruction is provided to prevent this problem by marking the x87 FPU tag word as empty.

The EMMS instruction should be used in each of the following cases:

- When an application using the x87 FPU instructions calls an MMX technology library/DLL (use the EMMS instruction at the end of the MMX code).

- When an application using MMX instructions calls a x87 FPU floating-point library/DLL (use the EMMS instruction before calling the x87 FPU code).
- When a switch is made between MMX code in a task or thread and other tasks or threads in cooperative operating systems, unless it is certain that more MMX instructions will be executed before any x87 FPU code.

EMMS is not required when mixing MMX technology instructions with Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions; see Section 11.6.7, “Interaction of Intel® SSE and SSE2 Instructions with x87 FPU and MMX Instructions.”

### 9.6.4 Mixing MMX and x87 FPU Instructions

An application can contain both x87 FPU floating-point and MMX instructions. However, frequent transitions between MMX and x87 FPU instructions are not recommended, because they can degrade performance in some processor implementations. When mixing MMX code with x87 FPU code, follow these guidelines:

- Keep the code in separate modules, procedures, or routines.
- Do not rely on register contents across transitions between x87 FPU and MMX code modules.
- When transitioning between MMX code and x87 FPU code, save the MMX register state (if it will be needed in the future) and execute an EMMS instruction to empty the MMX state.
- When transitioning between x87 FPU code and MMX code, save the x87 FPU state if it will be needed in the future.

### 9.6.5 Interfacing with MMX Code

MMX technology enables direct access to all the MMX registers. This means that all existing interface conventions that apply to the use of the processor's general-purpose registers (EAX, EBX, etc.) also apply to the use of MMX registers.

An efficient interface to MMX routines might pass parameters and return values through the MMX registers or through a combination of memory locations (via the stack) and MMX registers. Do not use the EMMS instruction or mix MMX and x87 FPU code when using the MMX registers to pass parameters.

If a high-level language that does not support the MMX data types directly is used, the MMX data types can be defined as a 64-bit structure containing packed data types.

When implementing MMX instructions in high-level languages, other approaches can be taken, such as:

- Passing parameters to an MMX routine by passing a pointer to a structure via the stack.
- Returning a value from a function by returning a pointer to a structure.

### 9.6.6 Using MMX Code in a Multitasking Operating System Environment

An application needs to identify the nature of the multitasking operating system on which it runs. Each task retains its own state which must be saved when a task switch occurs. The processor state (context) consists of the general-purpose registers and the floating-point and MMX registers.

Operating systems can be classified into two types:

- Cooperative multitasking operating system.
- Preemptive multitasking operating system.

Cooperative multitasking operating systems do not save the FPU or MMX state when performing a context switch. Therefore, the application needs to save the relevant state before relinquishing direct or indirect control to the operating system.

Preemptive multitasking operating systems are responsible for saving and restoring the FPU and MMX state when performing a context switch. Therefore, the application does not have to save or restore the FPU and MMX state.

## 9.6.7 Exception Handling in MMX Code

MMX instructions generate the same type of memory-access exceptions as other IA-32 instructions (page fault, segment not present, and limit violations). Existing exception handlers do not have to be modified to handle these types of exceptions for MMX code.

Unless there is a pending floating-point exception, MMX instructions do not generate numeric exceptions. Therefore, there is no need to modify existing exception handlers or add new ones to handle numeric exceptions.

If a floating-point exception is pending, the subsequent MMX instruction generates a numeric error exception (interrupt 16 and/or assertion of the FERR# pin). The MMX instruction resumes execution upon return from the exception handler.

## 9.6.8 Register Mapping

MMX registers and their tags are mapped to physical locations of the floating-point registers and their tags. Register aliasing and mapping is described in more detail in Chapter 15, “Intel® MMX™ Technology System Programming,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.

## 9.6.9 Effect of Instruction Prefixes on MMX Instructions

Table 9-3 describes the effect of instruction prefixes on MMX instructions. Unpredictable behavior can range from being treated as a reserved operation on one generation of IA-32 processors to generating an invalid opcode exception on another generation of processors.
