## PROGRAMMING WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE INSTRUCTIONS

---

General-purpose (GP) instructions are a subset of the IA-32 instructions that represent the fundamental instruction set for the Intel IA-32 processors. These instructions were introduced into the IA-32 architecture with the first IA-32 processors (the Intel 8086 and 8088). Additional instructions were added to the general-purpose instruction set in subsequent families of IA-32 processors (the Intel 286, Intel386, Intel486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II processors).

Intel 64 architecture further extends the capability of most general-purpose instructions so that they are able to handle 64-bit data in 64-bit mode. A small number of general-purpose instructions (still supported in non-64-bit modes) are not supported in 64-bit mode.

General-purpose instructions perform basic data movement, memory addressing, arithmetic and logical, program flow control, input/output, and string operations on a set of integer, pointer, and BCD data types. This chapter provides an overview of the general-purpose instructions. See the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volumes 2A, 2B, 2C, & 2D, for detailed descriptions of individual instructions.

## 7.1 PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT FOR GP INSTRUCTIONS

The programming environment for the general-purpose instructions consists of the set of registers and address space. The environment includes the following items:

- **General-purpose registers** — Eight 32-bit general-purpose registers (see Section 3.4.1, "General-Purpose Registers") are used in non-64-bit modes to address operands in memory. These registers are referenced by the names EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI, and ESP.
- **Segment registers** — The six 16-bit segment registers contain segment pointers for use in accessing memory (see Section 3.4.2, "Segment Registers"). These registers are referenced by the names CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, and GS.
- **EFLAGS register** — This 32-bit register (see Section 3.4.3, "EFLAGS Register") is used to provide status and control for basic arithmetic, compare, and system operations.
- **EIP register** — This 32-bit register contains the current instruction pointer (see Section 3.5, "Instruction Pointer").

General-purpose instructions operate on the following data types. The width of valid data types is dependent on processor mode (see Chapter 4):

- Bytes, words, doublewords.
- Signed and unsigned byte, word, doubleword integers.
- Near and far pointers.
- Bit fields.
- BCD integers.

## 7.2 PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT FOR GP INSTRUCTIONS IN 64-BIT MODE

The programming environment for the general-purpose instructions in 64-bit mode is similar to that described in Section 7.1.

- **General-purpose registers** — In 64-bit mode, sixteen general-purpose registers are available. These include the eight GPRs described in Section 7.1 and eight new GPRs (R8D-R15D). R8D-R15D are available by using a REX prefix. All sixteen GPRs can be promoted to 64 bits. The 64-bit registers are referenced as RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RBP, RSI, RDI, RSP, and R8-R15 (see Section 3.4.1.1, "General-Purpose Registers in 64-Bit Mode"). Promotion to 64-bit operand requires REX prefix encodings.

- **Segment registers** — In 64-bit mode, segmentation is available but it is set up uniquely (see Section 3.4.2.1, “Segment Registers in 64-Bit Mode”).
- **Flags and Status register** — When the processor is running in 64-bit mode, EFLAGS becomes the 64-bit RFLAGS register (see Section 3.4.3, “EFLAGS Register”).
- **Instruction Pointer register** — In 64-bit mode, the EIP register becomes the 64-bit RIP register (see Section 3.5.1, “Instruction Pointer in 64-Bit Mode”).

General-purpose instructions operate on the following data types in 64-bit mode. The width of valid data types is dependent on default operand size, address size, or a prefix that overrides the default size:

- Bytes, words, doublewords, quadwords.
- Signed and unsigned byte, word, doubleword, quadword integers.
- Near and far pointers.
- Bit fields.

- Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volumes 2A, 2B, 2C, & 2D, for a complete listing of all instructions. This information documents the behavior of individual instructions in the 64-bit mode context.

## 7.3 SUMMARY OF GP INSTRUCTIONS

General purpose instructions are divided into the following subgroups:

- Data transfer.
- Binary arithmetic.
- Decimal arithmetic.
- Logical.
- Shift and rotate.
- Bit and byte.
- Control transfer.
- String.
- I/O.
- Enter and Leave.
- Flag control.
- Segment register.
- Miscellaneous.

Each sub-group of general-purpose instructions is discussed in the context of non-64-bit mode operation first. Changes in 64-bit mode beyond those affected by the use of the REX prefixes are discussed in separate sub-sections within each subgroup. For a simple list of general-purpose instructions by subgroup, see Chapter 5.

### 7.3.1 Data Transfer Instructions

The data transfer instructions move bytes, words, doublewords, or quadwords both between memory and the processor’s registers and between registers. For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are divided into subordinate subgroups that provide for:

- General data movement.

- Exchange.
- Stack manipulation.
- Type conversion.

### 7.3.1.1 General Data Movement Instructions

**Move instructions** — The MOV (move) and CMOVcc (conditional move) instructions transfer data between memory and registers or between registers.

The MOV instruction performs basic load data and store data operations between memory and the processor's registers and data movement operations between registers. It handles data transfers along the paths listed in Table 7-1. (See "MOV—Move to/from Control Registers" and "MOV—Move to/from Debug Registers" in Chapter 4, "Instruction Set Reference, M-U," of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for information on moving data to and from the control and debug registers.)

The MOV instruction cannot move data from one memory location to another or from one segment register to another segment register. Memory-to-memory moves are performed with the MOVS (string move) instruction (see Section 7.3.9, "String Operations").

**Conditional move instructions** — The CMOVcc instructions are a group of instructions that check the state of the status flags in the EFLAGS register and perform a move operation if the flags are in a specified state. These instructions can be used to move a 16-bit or 32-bit value from memory to a general-purpose register or from one general-purpose register to another. The flag state being tested is specified with a condition code (cc) associated with the instruction. If the condition is not satisfied, a move is not performed and execution continues with the instruction following the CMOVcc instruction.

**Table 7-1. Move Instruction Operations**

Table 7-2 shows mnemonics for CMOVcc instructions and the conditions being tested for each instruction. The condition code mnemonics are appended to the letters "CMOV" to form the mnemonics for CMOVcc instructions. The instructions listed in Table 7-2 as pairs (for example, CMOVA/CMOVNBE) are alternate names for the same instruction. The assembler provides these alternate names to make it easier to read program listings.

CMOVcc instructions are useful for optimizing small IF constructions. They also help eliminate branching overhead for IF statements and the possibility of branch mispredictions by the processor.

These conditional move instructions are supported in the P6 family, Pentium 4, and Intel Xeon processors. Software can check if CMOVcc instructions are supported by checking the processor's feature information with the CPUID instruction.

7.3.1.2 Exchange Instructions

The exchange instructions swap the contents of one or more operands and, in some cases, perform additional operations such as asserting the LOCK signal or modifying flags in the EFLAGS register.

The XCHG (exchange) instruction swaps the contents of two operands. This instruction takes the place of three MOV instructions and does not require a temporary location to save the contents of one operand location while the other is being loaded. When a memory operand is used with the XCHG instruction, the processor’s LOCK signal is automatically asserted. This instruction is thus useful for implementing semaphores or similar data structures for process synchronization. See “Bus Locking” in Chapter 11, “Multiple-Processor Management,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for more information on bus locking.

The BSWAP (byte swap) instruction reverses the byte order in a 32-bit register operand. Bit positions 0 through 7 are exchanged with 24 through 31, and bit positions 8 through 15 are exchanged with 16 through 23. Executing this instruction twice in a row leaves the register with the same value as before. The BSWAP instruction is useful for converting between “big-endian” and “little-endian” data formats. This instruction also speeds execution of decimal arithmetic. (The XCHG instruction can be used to swap the bytes in a word.)

| CMOVNO                            | OF = 0                  | Not overflow              |
| CMOVS                             | SF = 1                  | Sign (negative)           |
| CMOVNS                            | SF = 0                  | Not sign (non-negative)   |

The XADD (exchange and add) instruction swaps two operands and then stores the sum of the two operands in the destination operand. The status flags in the EFLAGS register indicate the result of the addition. This instruction can be combined with the LOCK prefix (see “LOCK—Assert LOCK# Signal Prefix” in Chapter 3, “Instruction Set Reference, A-L,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A) in a multiprocessing system to allow multiple processors to execute one DO loop.

The CMPXCHG (compare and exchange) and CMPXCHG8B (compare and exchange 8 bytes) instructions are used to synchronize operations in systems that use multiple processors. The CMPXCHG instruction requires three operands: a source operand in a register, another source operand in the EAX register, and a destination operand. If the values contained in the destination operand and the EAX register are equal, the destination operand is replaced with the value of the other source operand (the value not in the EAX register). Otherwise, the original

value of the destination operand is loaded in the EAX register. The status flags in the EFLAGS register reflect the result that would have been obtained by subtracting the destination operand from the value in the EAX register.

The CMPXCHG instruction is commonly used for testing and modifying semaphores. It checks to see if a semaphore is free. If the semaphore is free, it is marked allocated; otherwise it gets the ID of the current owner. This is all done in one uninterruptible operation. In a single-processor system, the CMPXCHG instruction eliminates the need to switch to protection level 0 (to disable interrupts) before executing multiple instructions to test and modify a semaphore.

For multiple processor systems, CMPXCHG can be combined with the LOCK prefix to perform the compare and exchange operation atomically. (See “Locked Atomic Operations” in Chapter 11, “Multiple-Processor Management,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for more information on atomic operations.)

The CMPXCHG8B instruction also requires three operands: a 64-bit value in EDX:EAX, a 64-bit value in ECX:EBX, and a destination operand in memory. The instruction compares the 64-bit value in the EDX:EAX registers with the destination operand. If they are equal, the 64-bit value in the ECX:EBX registers is stored in the destination operand. If the EDX:EAX registers and the destination are not equal, the destination is loaded in the EDX:EAX registers. The CMPXCHG8B instruction can be combined with the LOCK prefix to perform the operation atomically.

### 7.3.1.3 Exchange Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

The CMPXCHG16B instruction is available in 64-bit mode only. It is an extension of the functionality provided by CMPXCHG8B that operates on 128-bits of data.

### 7.3.1.4 Stack Manipulation Instructions

The PUSH, POP, PUSHA (push all registers), and POPA (pop all registers) instructions move data to and from the stack. The PUSH instruction decrements the stack pointer (contained in the ESP register), then copies the source operand to the top of stack (see Figure 7-1). It operates on memory operands, immediate operands, and register operands (including segment registers). The PUSH instruction is commonly used to place parameters on the stack before calling a procedure. It can also be used to reserve space on the stack for temporary variables.

The diagram, titled "Stack", illustrates the operation of the PUSH instruction. It shows two states of the stack: "Before Pushing Doubleword" and "After Pushing Doubleword".

```

- After Pushing Doubleword:** The stack pointer (ESP) has decremented by 4 bytes and now points to address  $n-4$ . The "Doubleword Value" is now stored at this new top-of-stack location.

Figure 7-1. Operation of the PUSH Instruction

The PUSHA instruction saves the contents of the eight general-purpose registers on the stack (see Figure 7-2). This instruction simplifies procedure calls by reducing the number of instructions required to save the contents of the general-purpose registers. The registers are pushed on the stack in the following order: EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, the initial value of ESP before EAX was pushed, EBP, ESI, and EDI.

![Diagram showing the operation of the PUSHA instruction. It illustrates the stack state before and after pushing registers. Before pushing, the stack grows downwards from address n to n-36, with ESP at n-4. After pushing, registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, Old ESP, EBP, ESI, and EDI are pushed onto the stack, and ESP is updated to point to the new top of the stack at n-36.](63939c9e87ec1167d54f490e2b7fe47b_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the operation of the PUSHA instruction on the stack. It is divided into two parts: 'Before Pushing Registers' and 'After Pushing Registers'. On the left, a vertical arrow labeled 'Stack Growth' points downwards, indicating that the stack grows from higher memory addresses to lower ones. The stack is represented as a series of horizontal slots, each 32 bits wide (labeled 31 to 0). In the 'Before Pushing Registers' state, the stack pointer (ESP) points to the top of the stack at address n-4. The stack contains data from address n down to n-36. In the 'After Pushing Registers' state, the registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, Old ESP, EBP, ESI, and EDI have been pushed onto the stack. The ESP register now points to the new top of the stack at address n-36. The stack grows from address n down to n-36.

Figure 7-2. Operation of the PUSHA Instruction

The POP instruction copies the word or doubleword at the current top of stack (indicated by the ESP register) to the location specified with the destination operand. It then increments the ESP register to point to the new top of stack (see Figure 7-3). The destination operand may specify a general-purpose register, a segment register, or a memory location.

In the 'Before Popping Doubleword' state, the stack pointer (ESP) points to the top of the stack at address n-8. The stack contains data from address n down to n-8. In the 'After Popping Doubleword' state, the doubleword value has been popped from the stack and moved to the destination. The ESP register is now incremented to point to the new top of the stack at address n-4. The stack grows from address n down to n-8.

Figure 7-3. Operation of the POP Instruction

The POPA instruction reverses the effect of the PUSHA instruction. It pops the top eight words or doublewords from the top of the stack into the general-purpose registers, except for the ESP register (see Figure 7-4). If the operand-size attribute is 32, the doublewords on the stack are transferred to the registers in the following order: EDI, ESI, EBP, ignore doubleword, EBX, EDX, ECX, and EAX. The ESP register is restored by the action of popping the stack. If the operand-size attribute is 16, the words on the stack are transferred to the registers in the following order: DI, SI, BP, ignore word, BX, DX, CX, and AX.

![Diagram illustrating the operation of the POPA instruction. It shows a stack growing downwards from higher addresses to lower addresses. Before popping, the stack contains registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, Ignored, EBP, ESI, and EDI. After popping, the stack pointer (ESP) moves up to the address of the 'Ignored' entry, and the registers EAX, ECX, EDX, and EBX are restored from the stack.](76355e5a3237d2474f3ae61bbeba2eb5_img.jpg)

The diagram shows a stack with addresses increasing from 0 at the top to 31 at the bottom. An arrow labeled 'Stack Growth' points downwards. The stack is divided into two states: 'Before Popping Registers' and 'After Popping Registers'.

**Before Popping Registers:** The stack contains the following registers from top to bottom: EAX (at address n-8), ECX (at address n-12), EDX (at address n-16), EBX (at address n-20), Ignored (at address n-24), EBP (at address n-28), ESI (at address n-32), and EDI (at address n-36). The ESP register points to the address n-36.

**After Popping Registers:** The stack contains the registers EAX, ECX, EDX, and EBX. The ESP register points to the address n-24, which is the address of the 'Ignored' entry.

Diagram illustrating the operation of the POPA instruction. It shows a stack growing downwards from higher addresses to lower addresses. Before popping, the stack contains registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, Ignored, EBP, ESI, and EDI. After popping, the stack pointer (ESP) moves up to the address of the 'Ignored' entry, and the registers EAX, ECX, EDX, and EBX are restored from the stack.

Figure 7-4. Operation of the POPA Instruction

### 7.3.1.5 Stack Manipulation Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

In 64-bit mode, the stack pointer size is 64 bits and cannot be overridden by an instruction prefix. In implicit stack references, address-size overrides are ignored. Pushes and pops of 32-bit values on the stack are not possible in 64-bit mode. 16-bit pushes and pops are supported by using the 66H operand-size prefix. PUSHAD, POPAD, POPA, and POPAD are not supported.

### 7.3.1.6 Type Conversion Instructions

The type conversion instructions convert bytes into words, words into doublewords, and doublewords into quadwords. These instructions are especially useful for converting integers to larger integer formats, because they perform sign extension (see Figure 7-5).

Two kinds of type conversion instructions are provided: simple conversion and move and convert.

![Diagram illustrating sign extension. It shows a 16-bit word being extended to a 32-bit doubleword. The sign bit (bit 15) is copied into all bits of the upper byte (bits 16-31).](129e1fe2b4f1a531e5e9627f50c1ed78_img.jpg)

The diagram shows two bit patterns. The top pattern is a 16-bit word with bits 15 to 0. Bit 15 is labeled 'S' (sign) and bits 14 to 0 are labeled 'N' (data). The bottom pattern is a 32-bit doubleword with bits 31 to 0. Bits 31 to 16 are labeled 'S' and bits 15 to 0 are labeled 'N'. This illustrates how the sign bit is extended into the upper byte.

Diagram illustrating sign extension. It shows a 16-bit word being extended to a 32-bit doubleword. The sign bit (bit 15) is copied into all bits of the upper byte (bits 16-31).

Figure 7-5. Sign Extension

**Simple conversion** — The CBW (convert byte to word), CWDE (convert word to doubleword extended), CWD (convert word to doubleword), and CDQ (convert doubleword to quadword) instructions perform sign extension to double the size of the source operand.

The CBW instruction copies the sign (bit 7) of the byte in the AL register into every bit position of the upper byte of the AX register. The CWDE instruction copies the sign (bit 15) of the word in the AX register into every bit position of the high word of the EAX register.

The CWD instruction copies the sign (bit 15) of the word in the AX register into every bit position in the DX register. The CDQ instruction copies the sign (bit 31) of the doubleword in the EAX register into every bit position in the EDX register. The CWD instruction can be used to produce a doubleword dividend from a word before a word division, and the CDQ instruction can be used to produce a quadword dividend from a doubleword before doubleword division.

**Move with sign or zero extension** — The MOVSX (move with sign extension) and MOVZX (move with zero extension) instructions move the source operand into a register then perform the sign extension.

The MOVSX instruction extends an 8-bit value to a 16-bit value or an 8-bit or 16-bit value to a 32-bit value by sign extending the source operand, as shown in Figure 7-5. The MOVZX instruction extends an 8-bit value to a 16-bit value or an 8-bit or 16-bit value to a 32-bit value by zero extending the source operand.

### 7.3.1.7 Type Conversion Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

The MOVSXD instruction operates on 64-bit data. It sign-extends a 32-bit value to 64 bits. This instruction is not encodable in non-64-bit modes.

## 7.3.2 Binary Arithmetic Instructions

Binary arithmetic instructions operate on 8-, 16-, and 32-bit numeric data encoded as signed or unsigned binary integers. The binary arithmetic instructions may also be used in algorithms that operate on decimal (BCD) values.

For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that:

- Add and subtract.
- Increment and decrement.
- Compare and change signs.
- Multiply and divide.

### 7.3.2.1 Addition and Subtraction Instructions

The ADD (add integers), ADC (add integers with carry), SUB (subtract integers), and SBB (subtract integers with borrow) instructions perform addition and subtraction operations on signed or unsigned integer operands.

The ADD instruction computes the sum of two integer operands.

The ADC instruction computes the sum of two integer operands, plus 1 if the CF flag is set. This instruction is used to propagate a carry when adding numbers in stages.

The SUB instruction computes the difference of two integer operands.

The SBB instruction computes the difference of two integer operands, minus 1 if the CF flag is set. This instruction is used to propagate a borrow when subtracting numbers in stages.

### 7.3.2.2 Increment and Decrement Instructions

The INC (increment) and DEC (decrement) instructions add 1 to or subtract 1 from an unsigned integer operand, respectively. A primary use of these instructions is for implementing counters.

### 7.3.2.3 Increment and Decrement Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

The INC and DEC instructions are supported in 64-bit mode. However, some forms of INC and DEC (the register operand being encoded using register extension field in the MOD R/M byte) are not encodable in 64-bit mode because the opcodes are treated as REX prefixes.

### 7.3.2.4 Comparison and Sign Change Instructions

The CMP (compare) instruction computes the difference between two integer operands and updates the OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF flags according to the result. The source operands are not modified, nor is the result saved. The CMP instruction is commonly used in conjunction with a Jcc (jump) or SETcc (byte set on condition) instruction, with the latter instructions performing an action based on the result of a CMP instruction.

The NEG (negate) instruction subtracts a signed integer operand from zero. The effect of the NEG instruction is to change the sign of a two's complement operand while keeping its magnitude.

### 7.3.2.5 Multiplication and Division Instructions

The processor provides two multiply instructions, MUL (unsigned multiply) and IMUL (signed multiply), and two divide instructions, DIV (unsigned divide) and IDIV (signed divide).

The MUL instruction multiplies two unsigned integer operands. The result is computed to twice the size of the source operands (for example, if word operands are being multiplied, the result is a doubleword).

The IMUL instruction multiplies two signed integer operands. The result is computed to twice the size of the source operands; however, in some cases the result is truncated to the size of the source operands (see “IMUL—Signed Multiply” in Chapter 3, “Instruction Set Reference, A-L,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A).

The DIV instruction divides one unsigned operand by another unsigned operand and returns a quotient and a remainder.

The IDIV instruction is identical to the DIV instruction, except that IDIV performs a signed division.

### 7.3.3 Decimal Arithmetic Instructions

Decimal arithmetic can be performed by combining the binary arithmetic instructions ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV (discussed in Section 7.3.2, “Binary Arithmetic Instructions”) with the decimal arithmetic instructions. The decimal arithmetic instructions are provided to carry out the following operations:

- To adjust the results of a previous binary arithmetic operation to produce a valid BCD result.
- To adjust the operands of a subsequent binary arithmetic operation so that the operation will produce a valid BCD result.

These instructions operate on both packed and unpacked BCD values. For the purpose of this discussion, the decimal arithmetic instructions are divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that provide:

- Packed BCD adjustments.
- Unpacked BCD adjustments.

#### 7.3.3.1 Packed BCD Adjustment Instructions

The DAA (decimal adjust after addition) and DAS (decimal adjust after subtraction) instructions adjust the results of operations performed on packed BCD integers (see Section 4.7, “BCD and Packed BCD Integers”). Adding two packed BCD values requires two instructions: an ADD instruction followed by a DAA instruction. The ADD instruction adds (binary addition) the two values and stores the result in the AL register. The DAA instruction then adjusts the value in the AL register to obtain a valid, 2-digit, packed BCD value and sets the CF flag if a decimal carry occurred as the result of the addition.

Likewise, subtracting one packed BCD value from another requires a SUB instruction followed by a DAS instruction. The SUB instruction subtracts (binary subtraction) one BCD value from another and stores the result in the AL register. The DAS instruction then adjusts the value in the AL register to obtain a valid, 2-digit, packed BCD value and sets the CF flag if a decimal borrow occurred as the result of the subtraction.

#### 7.3.3.2 Unpacked BCD Adjustment Instructions

The AAA (ASCII adjust after addition), AAS (ASCII adjust after subtraction), AAM (ASCII adjust after multiplication), and AAD (ASCII adjust before division) instructions adjust the results of arithmetic operations performed on unpacked BCD values (see Section 4.7, “BCD and Packed BCD Integers”). All these instructions assume that the value to be adjusted is stored in the AL register or, in one instance, the AL and AH registers.

The AAA instruction adjusts the contents of the AL register following the addition of two unpacked BCD values. It converts the binary value in the AL register into a decimal value and stores the result in the AL register in unpacked BCD format (the decimal number is stored in the lower 4 bits of the register and the upper 4 bits are cleared). If a decimal carry occurred as a result of the addition, the CF flag is set and the contents of the AH register are incremented by 1.

The AAS instruction adjusts the contents of the AL register following the subtraction of two unpacked BCD values. Here again, a binary value is converted into an unpacked BCD value. If a borrow was required to complete the decimal subtract, the CF flag is set and the contents of the AH register are decremented by 1.

The AAM instruction adjusts the contents of the AL register following a multiplication of two unpacked BCD values. It converts the binary value in the AL register into a decimal value and stores the least significant digit of the result in the AL register (in unpacked BCD format) and the most significant digit, if there is one, in the AH register (also in unpacked BCD format).

The AAD instruction adjusts a two-digit BCD value so that when the value is divided with the DIV instruction, a valid unpacked BCD result is obtained. The instruction converts the BCD value in registers AH (most significant digit) and AL (least significant digit) into a binary value and stores the result in register AL. When the value in AL is divided by an unpacked BCD value, the quotient and remainder will be automatically encoded in unpacked BCD format.

### 7.3.4 Decimal Arithmetic Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

Decimal arithmetic instructions are not supported in 64-bit mode, they are either invalid or not encodable.

### 7.3.5 Logical Instructions

The logical instructions AND, OR, XOR (exclusive or), and NOT perform the standard Boolean operations for which they are named. The AND, OR, and XOR instructions require two operands; the NOT instruction operates on a single operand.

### 7.3.6 Shift and Rotate Instructions

The shift and rotate instructions rearrange the bits within an operand. For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are further divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that:

- Shift bits
- Double-shift bits (move them between operands)
- Rotate bits

#### 7.3.6.1 Shift Instructions

The SAL (shift arithmetic left), SHL (shift logical left), SAR (shift arithmetic right), SHR (shift logical right) instructions perform an arithmetic or logical shift of the bits in a byte, word, or doubleword.

The SAL and SHL instructions perform the same operation (see Figure 7-6). They shift the source operand left by from 1 to 31 bit positions. Empty bit positions are cleared. The CF flag is loaded with the last bit shifted out of the operand.

![Diagram illustrating the SHL/SAL instruction operation. It shows the initial state of the CF flag and the operand, followed by the state after a 1-bit and a 10-bit left shift.](bb2dd45140378c8d2df32f361a4ea4b3_img.jpg)

Figure 7-6. SHL/SAL Instruction Operation

The SHR instruction shifts the source operand right by from 1 to 31 bit positions (see Figure 7-7). As with the SHL/SAL instruction, the empty bit positions are cleared and the CF flag is loaded with the last bit shifted out of the operand.

![Diagram illustrating the SHR instruction operation. It shows the initial state of the operand and CF flag, followed by the state after a 1-bit and a 10-bit right shift.](cb801472c1446dfc10793c006674b0f6_img.jpg)

Diagram illustrating the SHR instruction operation. It shows the initial state of the operand and CF flag, followed by the state after a 1-bit and a 10-bit right shift.

Figure 7-7. SHR Instruction Operation

The SAR instruction shifts the source operand right by from 1 to 31 bit positions (see Figure 7-8). This instruction differs from the SHR instruction in that it preserves the sign of the source operand by clearing empty bit positions if the operand is positive or setting the empty bits if the operand is negative. Again, the CF flag is loaded with the last bit shifted out of the operand.

The SAR and SHR instructions can also be used to perform division by powers of 2 (see “SAL/SAR/SHL/SHR—Shift Instructions” in Chapter 4, “Instruction Set Reference, M-U,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B).

![Diagram showing SAR instruction operation for positive and negative operands.](700878b16fd63222d10e4764b81675a6_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the operation of the SAR (Shift Arithmetic Right) instruction. It shows two scenarios: one for a positive operand and one for a negative operand. In both cases, the initial state shows a 32-bit operand and the CF (Carry Flag) is set to 'X' (unknown). After a 1-bit SAR instruction, the operand is shifted right by one bit, and the CF is set to the value of the bit shifted out (the original MSB).

Diagram showing SAR instruction operation for positive and negative operands.

Figure 7-8. SAR Instruction Operation

7.3.6.2 Double-Shift Instructions

The SHLD (shift left double) and SHRD (shift right double) instructions shift a specified number of bits from one operand to another (see Figure 7-9). They are provided to facilitate operations on unaligned bit strings. They can also be used to implement a variety of bit string move operations.

![Diagram showing SHLD and SHRD instruction operations.](9aa5975930cebfd669fe7585394719e0_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the operation of the SHLD (Shift Left Double) and SHRD (Shift Right Double) instructions. It shows two scenarios: SHLD and SHRD. In both cases, the destination operand is shifted left or right by a specified number of bits, and the source operand is shifted right or left by the same number of bits. The CF (Carry Flag) is set to the last bit shifted out of the destination operand.

**SHLD Instruction**

Destination (Memory or Register): 31 0

Source (Register): 31 0

CF: X

**SHRD Instruction**

Source (Register): 31 0

Destination (Memory or Register): 31 0

CF: X

Diagram showing SHLD and SHRD instruction operations.

Figure 7-9. SHLD and SHRD Instruction Operations

The SHLD instruction shifts the bits in the destination operand to the left and fills the empty bit positions (in the destination operand) with bits shifted out of the source operand. The destination and source operands must be the same length (either words or doublewords). The shift count can range from 0 to 31 bits. The result of this shift operation is stored in the destination operand, and the source operand is not modified. The CF flag is loaded with the last bit shifted out of the destination operand.

The SHRD instruction operates the same as the SHLD instruction except bits are shifted to the right in the destination operand, with the empty bit positions filled with bits shifted out of the source operand.

### 7.3.6.3 Rotate Instructions

The ROL (rotate left), ROR (rotate right), RCL (rotate through carry left) and RCR (rotate through carry right) instructions rotate the bits in the destination operand out of one end and back through the other end (see Figure 7-10). Unlike a shift, no bits are lost during a rotation. The rotate count can range from 0 to 31.

![Diagram illustrating the operations of ROL, ROR, RCL, and RCR instructions. Each instruction shows a 32-bit destination operand (bits 31 to 0) and the CF flag. ROL rotates left, moving bit 31 to CF and CF to bit 0. ROR rotates right, moving bit 0 to CF and CF to bit 31. RCL rotates left through CF, moving bit 31 to CF and CF to bit 0. RCR rotates right through CF, moving bit 0 to CF and CF to bit 31.](55a415876cf7b7c2509c0318bb857efa_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the operations of four rotate instructions: ROL, ROR, RCL, and RCR. Each instruction is shown with a 32-bit destination operand (bits 31 to 0) and the CF flag.

- ROL Instruction:** Rotates left. Bit 31 moves to the CF flag, and the CF flag moves to bit 0.
- ROR Instruction:** Rotates right. Bit 0 moves to the CF flag, and the CF flag moves to bit 31.
- RCL Instruction:** Rotates left through the CF flag. Bit 31 moves to the CF flag, and the CF flag moves to bit 0.
- RCR Instruction:** Rotates right through the CF flag. Bit 0 moves to the CF flag, and the CF flag moves to bit 31.

Diagram illustrating the operations of ROL, ROR, RCL, and RCR instructions. Each instruction shows a 32-bit destination operand (bits 31 to 0) and the CF flag. ROL rotates left, moving bit 31 to CF and CF to bit 0. ROR rotates right, moving bit 0 to CF and CF to bit 31. RCL rotates left through CF, moving bit 31 to CF and CF to bit 0. RCR rotates right through CF, moving bit 0 to CF and CF to bit 31.

**Figure 7-10. ROL, ROR, RCL, and RCR Instruction Operations**

The ROL instruction rotates the bits in the operand to the left (toward more significant bit locations). The ROR instruction rotates the operand right (toward less significant bit locations).

The RCL instruction rotates the bits in the operand to the left, through the CF flag. This instruction treats the CF flag as a one-bit extension on the upper end of the operand. Each bit that exits from the most significant bit location of the operand moves into the CF flag. At the same time, the bit in the CF flag enters the least significant bit location of the operand.

The RCR instruction rotates the bits in the operand to the right through the CF flag.

For all the rotate instructions, the CF flag always contains the value of the last bit rotated out of the operand, even if the instruction does not use the CF flag as an extension of the operand. The value of this flag can then be tested by a conditional jump instruction (JC or JNC).

### 7.3.7 Bit and Byte Instructions

These instructions operate on bit or byte strings. For the purpose of this discussion, they are further divided into subordinate subgroups that:

- Test and modify a single bit.
- Scan a bit string.
- Set a byte given conditions.
- Test operands and report results.

7.3.7.1 Bit Test and Modify Instructions

The bit test and modify instructions (see Table 7-3) operate on a single bit, which can be in an operand. The location of the bit is specified as an offset from the least significant bit of the operand. When the processor identifies the bit to be tested and modified, it first loads the CF flag with the current value of the bit. Then it assigns a new value to the selected bit, as determined by the modify operation for the instruction.

Table 7-3. Bit Test and Modify Instructions

| Instruction                   | Effect on CF Flag      | Effect on Selected Bit            |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| BT (Bit Test)                 | CF flag ← Selected Bit | No effect                         |
| BTS (Bit Test and Set)        | CF flag ← Selected Bit | Selected Bit ← 1                  |
| BTR (Bit Test and Reset)      | CF flag ← Selected Bit | Selected Bit ← 0                  |
| BTC (Bit Test and Complement) | CF flag ← Selected Bit | Selected Bit ← NOT (Selected Bit) |

7.3.7.2 Bit Scan Instructions

The BSF (bit scan forward) and BSR (bit scan reverse) instructions scan a bit string in a source operand for a set bit and store the bit index of the first set bit found in a destination register. The bit index is the offset from the least significant bit (bit 0) in the bit string to the first set bit. The BSF instruction scans the source operand low-to-high (from bit 0 of the source operand toward the most significant bit); the BSR instruction scans high-to-low (from the most significant bit toward the least significant bit).

7.3.7.3 Byte Set on Condition Instructions

The SETcc (set byte on condition) instructions set a destination-operand byte to 0 or 1, depending on the state of selected status flags (CF, OF, SF, ZF, and PF) in the EFLAGS register. The suffix (cc) added to the SET mnemonic determines the condition being tested for.

For example, the SETO instruction tests for overflow. If the OF flag is set, the destination byte is set to 1; if OF is clear, the destination byte is cleared to 0. Appendix B, “EFLAGS Condition Codes,” lists the conditions it is possible to test for with this instruction.

7.3.7.4 Test Instruction

The TEST instruction performs a logical AND of two operands and sets the SF, ZF, and PF flags according to the results. The flags can then be tested by the conditional jump or loop instructions or the SETcc instructions. The TEST instruction differs from the AND instruction in that it does not alter either of the operands.

7.3.8 Control Transfer Instructions

The processor provides both conditional and unconditional control transfer instructions to direct the flow of program execution. Conditional transfers are taken only for specified states of the status flags in the EFLAGS register. Unconditional control transfers are always executed.

For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are further divided into subordinate subgroups that process:

- Unconditional transfers.
- Conditional transfers.
- Software interrupts.

7.3.8.1 Unconditional Transfer Instructions

The JMP, CALL, RET, INT, and IRET instructions transfer program control to another location (destination address) in the instruction stream. The destination can be within the same code segment (near transfer) or in a different code segment (far transfer).

**Jump instruction** — The JMP (jump) instruction unconditionally transfers program control to a destination instruction. The transfer is one-way; that is, a return address is not saved. A destination operand specifies the address (the instruction pointer) of the destination instruction. The address can be a **relative address** or an **absolute address**.

A **relative address** is a displacement (offset) with respect to the address in the EIP register. The destination address (a near pointer) is formed by adding the displacement to the address in the EIP register. The displacement is specified with a signed integer, allowing jumps either forward or backward in the instruction stream.

An **absolute address** is an offset from address 0 of a segment. It can be specified in either of the following ways:

- **An address in a general-purpose register** — This address is treated as a near pointer, which is copied into the EIP register. Program execution then continues at the new address within the current code segment.
- **An address specified using the standard addressing modes of the processor** — Here, the address can be a near pointer or a far pointer. If the address is for a near pointer, the address is translated into an offset and copied into the EIP register. If the address is for a far pointer, the address is translated into a segment selector (which is copied into the CS register) and an offset (which is copied into the EIP register).

In protected mode, the JMP instruction also allows jumps to a call gate, a task gate, and a task-state segment.

**Call and return instructions** — The CALL (call procedure) and RET (return from procedure) instructions allow a jump from one procedure (or subroutine) to another and a subsequent jump back (return) to the calling procedure.

The CALL instruction transfers program control from the current (or calling) procedure to another procedure (the called procedure). To allow a subsequent return to the calling procedure, the CALL instruction saves the current contents of the EIP register on the stack before jumping to the called procedure. The EIP register (prior to transferring program control) contains the address of the instruction following the CALL instruction. When this address is pushed on the stack, it is referred to as the **return instruction pointer** or **return address**.

The address of the called procedure (the address of the first instruction in the procedure being jumped to) is specified in a CALL instruction the same way as it is in a JMP instruction (see “Jump instruction” on page 7-15). The address can be specified as a relative address or an absolute address. If an absolute address is specified, it can be either a near or a far pointer.

The RET instruction transfers program control from the procedure currently being executed (the called procedure) back to the procedure that called it (the calling procedure). Transfer of control is accomplished by copying the return instruction pointer from the stack into the EIP register. Program execution then continues with the instruction pointed to by the EIP register.

The RET instruction has an optional operand, the value of which is added to the contents of the ESP register as part of the return operation. This operand allows the stack pointer to be incremented to remove parameters from the stack that were pushed on the stack by the calling procedure.

See Section 6.4, “Calling Procedures Using CALL and RET,” for more information on the mechanics of making procedure calls with the CALL and RET instructions.

**Return from interrupt instruction** — When the processor services an interrupt, it performs an implicit call to an interrupt-handling procedure. The IRET (return from interrupt) instruction returns program control from an interrupt handler to the interrupted procedure (that is, the procedure that was executing when the interrupt occurred). The IRET instruction performs a similar operation to the RET instruction (see “Call and return instructions” on page 7-15) except that it also restores the EFLAGS register from the stack. The contents of the EFLAGS register are automatically stored on the stack along with the return instruction pointer when the processor services an interrupt.

### 7.3.8.2 Conditional Transfer Instructions

The conditional transfer instructions execute jumps or loops that transfer program control to another instruction in the instruction stream if specified conditions are met. The conditions for control transfer are specified with a set of condition codes that define various states of the status flags (CF, ZF, OF, PF, and SF) in the EFLAGS register.

**Conditional jump instructions** — The Jcc (conditional) jump instructions transfer program control to a destination instruction if the conditions specified with the condition code (cc) associated with the instruction are satisfied (see Table 7-4). If the condition is not satisfied, execution continues with the instruction following the Jcc instruction. As with the JMP instruction, the transfer is one-way; that is, a return address is not saved.

**Table 7-4. Conditional Jump Instructions**

The destination operand specifies a relative address (a signed offset with respect to the address in the EIP register) that points to an instruction in the current code segment. The Jcc instructions do not support far transfers; however, far transfers can be accomplished with a combination of a Jcc and a JMP instruction (see “Jcc—Jump if Condition Is Met” in Chapter 3, “Instruction Set Reference, A-L,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A).

Table 7-4 shows the mnemonics for the Jcc instructions and the conditions being tested for each instruction. The condition code mnemonics are appended to the letter “J” to form the mnemonic for a Jcc instruction. The instructions are divided into two groups: unsigned and signed conditional jumps. These groups correspond to the results of operations performed on unsigned and signed integers respectively. Those instructions listed as pairs (for example, JA/JNBE) are alternate names for the same instruction. Assemblers provide alternate names to make it easier to read program listings.

The JCXZ and JECXZ instructions test the CX and ECX registers, respectively, instead of one or more status flags. See “Jump if zero instructions” on page 7-17 for more information about these instructions.

**Loop instructions** — The LOOP, LOOPE (loop while equal), LOOPZ (loop while zero), LOOPNE (loop while not equal), and LOOPNZ (loop while not zero) instructions are conditional jump instructions that use the value of the ECX register as a count for the number of times to execute a loop. All the loop instructions decrement the count in the ECX register each time they are executed and terminate a loop when zero is reached. The LOOPE, LOOPZ, LOOPNE, and LOOPNZ instructions also accept the ZF flag as a condition for terminating the loop before the count reaches zero.

The LOOP instruction decrements the contents of the ECX register (or the CX register, if the address-size attribute is 16), then tests the register for the loop-termination condition. If the count in the ECX register is non-zero, program control is transferred to the instruction address specified by the destination operand. The destination

operand is a relative address (that is, an offset relative to the contents of the EIP register), and it generally points to the first instruction in the block of code that is to be executed in the loop. When the count in the ECX register reaches zero, program control is transferred to the instruction immediately following the LOOP instruction, which terminates the loop. If the count in the ECX register is zero when the LOOP instruction is first executed, the register is pre-decremented to FFFFFFFFH, causing the loop to be executed  $2^{32}$  times.

The LOOPE and LOOPZ instructions perform the same operation (they are mnemonics for the same instruction). These instructions operate the same as the LOOP instruction, except that they also test the ZF flag.

If the count in the ECX register is not zero and the ZF flag is set, program control is transferred to the destination operand. When the count reaches zero or the ZF flag is clear, the loop is terminated by transferring program control to the instruction immediately following the LOOPE/LOOPZ instruction.

The LOOPNE and LOOPNZ instructions (mnemonics for the same instruction) operate the same as the LOOPE/LOOPZ instructions, except that they terminate the loop if the ZF flag is set.

**Jump if zero instructions** — The JECXZ (jump if ECX zero) instruction jumps to the location specified in the destination operand if the ECX register contains the value zero. This instruction can be used in combination with a loop instruction (LOOP, LOOPE, LOOPZ, LOOPNE, or LOOPNZ) to test the ECX register prior to beginning a loop. As described in “Loop instructions” on page 7-16, the loop instructions decrement the contents of the ECX register before testing for zero. If the value in the ECX register is zero initially, it will be decremented to FFFFFFFFH on the first loop instruction, causing the loop to be executed  $2^{32}$  times. To prevent this problem, a JECXZ instruction can be inserted at the beginning of the code block for the loop, causing a jump out of the loop if the ECX register count is initially zero. When used with repeated string scan and compare instructions, the JECXZ instruction can determine whether the loop terminated because the count reached zero or because the scan or compare conditions were satisfied.

The JCXZ (jump if CX is zero) instruction operates the same as the JECXZ instruction when the 16-bit address-size attribute is used. Here, the CX register is tested for zero.

### 7.3.8.3 Control Transfer Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

In 64-bit mode, the operand size for all near branches (CALL, RET, JCC, JCXZ, JMP, and LOOP) is forced to 64 bits. The listed instructions update the 64-bit RIP without need for a REX operand-size prefix.

Near branches in the following operations are forced to 64-bits (regardless of operand size prefixes):

- Truncation of the size of the instruction pointer.
- Size of a stack pop or push, due to CALL or RET.
- Size of a stack-pointer increment or decrement, due to CALL or RET.
- Indirect-branch operand size.

Note that the displacement field for relative branches is still limited to 32 bits and the address size for near branches is not forced.

Address size determines the register size (CX/ECX/RCX) used for JCXZ and LOOP. It also impacts the address calculation for memory indirect branches. Addresses size is 64 bits by default, although it can be over-ridden to 32 bits (using a prefix).

### 7.3.8.4 Software Interrupt Instructions

The INT *n* (software interrupt), INTO (interrupt on overflow), and BOUND (detect value out of range) instructions allow a program to explicitly raise a specified interrupt or exception, which in turn causes the handler routine for the interrupt or exception to be called.

The INT *n* instruction can raise any of the processor’s interrupts or exceptions by encoding the vector of the interrupt or exception in the instruction. This instruction can be used to support software generated interrupts or to test the operation of interrupt and exception handlers.

The IRET (return from interrupt) instruction returns program control from an interrupt handler to the interrupted procedure. The IRET instruction performs a similar operation to the RET instruction.

The CALL (call procedure) and RET (return from procedure) instructions allow a jump from one procedure to another and a subsequent return to the calling procedure. EFLAGS register contents are automatically stored on the stack along with the return instruction pointer when the processor services an interrupt.

The INTO instruction raises the overflow exception if the OF flag is set. If the flag is clear, execution continues without raising the exception. This instruction allows software to access the overflow exception handler explicitly to check for overflow conditions.

The BOUND instruction compares a signed value against upper and lower bounds, and raises the “BOUND range exceeded” exception if the value is less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound. This instruction is useful for operations such as checking an array index to make sure it falls within the range defined for the array.

### 7.3.8.5 Software Interrupt Instructions in 64-Bit Mode and Compatibility Mode

In 64-bit mode, the stack size is 8 bytes wide. IRET must pop 8-byte items off the stack. SS:RSP pops unconditionally. BOUND is not supported.

In compatibility mode, SS:RSP is popped only if the CPL changes.

## 7.3.9 String Operations

The GP instructions includes a set of **string instructions** that are designed to access large data structures; these are introduced in Section 7.3.9.1. Section 7.3.9.2 describes how REP prefixes can be used with these instructions to perform more complex **repeated string operations**. Certain processors optimize repeated string operations with **fast-string operation**, as described in Section 7.3.9.3. Section 7.3.9.4 explains how string operations can be used in 64-bit mode.

### 7.3.9.1 String Instructions

The MOVSB (Move String), CMPS (Compare string), SCAS (Scan string), LODS (Load string), and STOS (Store string) instructions permit large data structures, such as alphanumeric character strings, to be moved and examined in memory. These instructions operate on individual elements in a string, which can be a byte, word, or doubleword. The string elements to be operated on are identified with the ESI (source string element) and EDI (destination string element) registers. Both of these registers contain absolute addresses (offsets into a segment) that point to a string element.

By default, the ESI register addresses the segment identified with the DS segment register. A segment-override prefix allows the ESI register to be associated with the CS, SS, ES, FS, or GS segment register. The EDI register addresses the segment identified with the ES segment register; no segment override is allowed for the EDI register. The use of two different segment registers in the string instructions permits operations to be performed on strings located in different segments. Or by associating the ESI register with the ES segment register, both the source and destination strings can be located in the same segment. (This latter condition can also be achieved by loading the DS and ES segment registers with the same segment selector and allowing the ESI register to default to the DS register.)

The MOVSB instruction moves the string element addressed by the ESI register to the location addressed by the EDI register. The assembler recognizes three “short forms” of this instruction, which specify the size of the string to be moved: MOVSB (move byte string), MOVSW (move word string), and MOVSD (move doubleword string).

The CMPS instruction subtracts the destination string element from the source string element and updates the status flags (CF, ZF, OF, SF, PF, and AF) in the EFLAGS register according to the results. Neither string element is written back to memory. The assembler recognizes three “short forms” of the CMPS instruction: CMPSB (compare byte strings), CMPSW (compare word strings), and CMPSD (compare doubleword strings).

The SCAS instruction subtracts the destination string element from the contents of the EAX, AX, or AL register (depending on operand length) and updates the status flags according to the results. The string element and register contents are not modified. The following “short forms” of the SCAS instruction specify the operand length: SCASB (scan byte string), SCASW (scan word string), and SCASD (scan doubleword string).

The LODS instruction loads the source string element identified by the ESI register into the EAX register (for a doubleword string), the AX register (for a word string), or the AL register (for a byte string). The “short forms” for

this instruction are LODSB (load byte string), LODSW (load word string), and LODSD (load doubleword string). This instruction is usually used in a loop, where other instructions process each element of the string after they are loaded into the target register.

The STOS instruction stores the source string element from the EAX (doubleword string), AX (word string), or AL (byte string) register into the memory location identified with the EDI register. The “short forms” for this instruction are STOSB (store byte string), STOSW (store word string), and STOSD (store doubleword string). This instruction is also normally used in a loop. Here a string is commonly loaded into the register with a LODS instruction, operated on by other instructions, and then stored again in memory with a STOS instruction.

The I/O instructions (see Section 7.3.10, “I/O Instructions”) also perform operations on strings in memory.

### 7.3.9.2 Repeated String Operations

Each of the string instructions described in Section 7.3.9.1 perform one iteration of a string operation. To operate on strings longer than a doubleword, the string instructions can be combined with a repeat prefix (REP) to create a repeating instruction or be placed in a loop.

When used in string instructions, the ESI and EDI registers are automatically incremented or decremented after each iteration of an instruction to point to the next element (byte, word, or doubleword) in the string. String operations can thus begin at higher addresses and work toward lower ones, or they can begin at lower addresses and work toward higher ones. The DF flag in the EFLAGS register controls whether the registers are incremented (DF = 0) or decremented (DF = 1). The STD and CLD instructions set and clear this flag, respectively.

The following repeat prefixes can be used in conjunction with a count in the ECX register to cause a string instruction to repeat:

- **REP** — Repeat while the ECX register not zero.
- **REPE/REPZ** — Repeat while the ECX register not zero and the ZF flag is set.
- **REPNE/REPNZ** — Repeat while the ECX register not zero and the ZF flag is clear.

When a string instruction has a repeat prefix, the operation executes until one of the termination conditions specified by the prefix is satisfied. The REPE/REPZ and REPNE/REPNZ prefixes are used only with the CMPS and SCAS instructions. Also, note that a REP STOS instruction is the fastest way to initialize a large block of memory.

### 7.3.9.3 Fast-String Operation

To improve performance, more recent processors support modifications to the processor’s operation during the string store operations initiated with the MOVSB, MOVSW, STOS, and STOSB instructions. This optimized operation, called **fast-string operation**, is used when the execution of one of those instructions meets certain initial conditions (see below). Instructions using fast-string operation effectively operate on the string in groups that may include multiple elements of the native data size (byte, word, doubleword, or quadword). With fast-string operation, the processor recognizes interrupts and data breakpoints only on boundaries between these groups. Fast-string operation is used only if the source and destination addresses both use either the WB or WC memory types.

The initial conditions for fast-string operation are implementation-specific and may vary with the native string size. Examples of parameters that may impact the use of fast-string operation include the following:

- The alignment indicated in the EDI and ESI alignment registers.
- The address order of the string operation.
- The value of the initial operation counter (ECX).
- The difference between the source and destination addresses.

#### NOTE

Initial conditions for fast-string operation in future Intel 64 or IA-32 processor families may differ from above. The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual may contain model-specific information.

Software can disable fast-string operation by clearing the fast-string-enable bit (bit 0) of IA32\_MISC\_ENABLE MSR. However, Intel recommends that system software always enable fast-string operation.

When fast-string operation is enabled (because IA32\_MISC\_ENABLE[0] = 1), some processors may further enhance the operation of the REP MOVSB and REP STOSB instructions. A processor supports these enhancements if CPUID.07H:00H:EBX[9] is 1. The Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual may include model-specific recommendations for use of these enhancements.

The stores produced by fast-string operation may appear to execute out of order or be repeated. Software dependent upon sequential store ordering should not use string operations for the entire data structure to be stored. Data and semaphores should be separated. Order-dependent code should write to a discrete semaphore variable after any string operations to allow correctly ordered data to be seen by all processors. Atomicity of load and store operations is guaranteed only for native data elements of the string with native data size, and only if they are included in a single cache line. See Section 11.2.4, “Fast-String Operation and Out-of-Order Stores,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.

### 7.3.9.4 String Operations in 64-Bit Mode

The behavior of MOVSB (Move String), CMPS (Compare string), SCAS (Scan string), LODS (Load string), and STOS (Store string) instructions in 64-bit mode is similar to their behavior in non-64-bit modes, with the following differences:

- The source operand is specified by RSI or DS:ESI, depending on the address size attribute of the operation.
- The destination operand is specified by RDI or DS:EDI, depending on the address size attribute of the operation.
- Operation on 64-bit data is supported by using the REX.W prefix.

When using REP prefixes for string operations in 64-bit mode, the repeat count is specified by RCX or ECX (depending on the address size attribute of the operation). The default address size is 64 bits.

### 7.3.10 I/O Instructions

The IN (input from port to register), INS (input from port to string), OUT (output from register to port), and OUTS (output string to port) instructions move data between the processor’s I/O ports and either a register or memory.

The register I/O instructions (IN and OUT) move data between an I/O port and the EAX register (32-bit I/O), the AX register (16-bit I/O), or the AL (8-bit I/O) register. The I/O port being read or written to is specified with an immediate operand or an address in the DX register.

The block I/O instructions (INS and OUTS) instructions move blocks of data (strings) between an I/O port and memory. These instructions operate similar to the string instructions (see Section 7.3.9, “String Operations”). The ESI and EDI registers are used to specify string elements in memory and the repeat prefix (REP) is used to repeat the instructions to implement block moves. The assembler recognizes the following alternate mnemonics for these instructions: INSB (input byte), INSW (input word), and INSD (input doubleword), and OUTSB (output byte), OUTSW (output word), and OUTSD (output doubleword).

The INS and OUTS instructions use an address in the DX register to specify the I/O port to be read or written to.

### 7.3.11 I/O Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

For I/O instructions to and from memory, the differences in 64-bit mode are:

- The source operand is specified by RSI or DS:ESI, depending on the address size attribute of the operation.
- The destination operand is specified by RDI or DS:EDI, depending on the address size attribute of the operation.
- Operation on 64-bit data is not encodable and REX prefixes are silently ignored.

PROGRAMMING WITH GENERAL-PURPOSE INSTRUCTIONS

### 7.3.12 Enter and Leave Instructions

The ENTER and LEAVE instructions provide machine-language support for procedure calls in block-structured languages, such as C and Pascal. These instructions and the call and return mechanism that they support are described in detail in Section 6.6, “Procedure Calls for Block-Structured Languages.”

### 7.3.13 Flag Control (EFLAG) Instructions

The Flag Control (EFLAG) instructions allow the state of selected flags in the EFLAGS register to be read or modified. For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are further divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that manipulate:

- Carry and direction flags.
- The EFLAGS register.
- Interrupt flags.

#### 7.3.13.1 Carry and Direction Flag Instructions

The STC (set carry flag), CLC (clear carry flag), and CMC (complement carry flag) instructions allow the CF flag in the EFLAGS register to be modified directly. They are typically used to initialize the CF flag to a known state before an instruction that uses the flag in an operation is executed. They are also used in conjunction with the rotate-with-carry instructions (RCL and RCR).

The STD (set direction flag) and CLD (clear direction flag) instructions allow the DF flag in the EFLAGS register to be modified directly. The DF flag determines the direction in which index registers ESI and EDI are stepped when executing string processing instructions. If the DF flag is clear, the index registers are incremented after each iteration of a string instruction; if the DF flag is set, the registers are decremented.

#### 7.3.13.2 EFLAGS Transfer Instructions

The EFLAGS transfer instructions allow groups of flags in the EFLAGS register to be copied to a register or memory or be loaded from a register or memory.

The LAHF (load AH from flags) and SAHF (store AH into flags) instructions operate on five of the EFLAGS status flags (SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF). The LAHF instruction copies the status flags to bits 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 of the AH register, respectively. The contents of the remaining bits in the register (bits 5, 3, and 1) are unaffected, and the contents of the EFLAGS register remain unchanged. The SAHF instruction copies bits 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 from the AH register into the SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF flags, respectively in the EFLAGS register.

The PUSHF (push flags), PUSHFD (push flags double), POPF (pop flags), and POPFD (pop flags double) instructions copy the flags in the EFLAGS register to and from the stack. The PUSHF instruction pushes the lower word of the EFLAGS register onto the stack (see Figure 7-11). The PUSHFD instruction pushes the entire EFLAGS register onto the stack (with the RF and VM flags read as clear).

**Figure 7-11. Flags Affected by the PUSHF, POPF, PUSHFD, and POPFD Instructions**

The POPF instruction pops a word from the stack into the EFLAGS register. Only bits 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 of the EFLAGS register are affected with all uses of this instruction. If the current privilege level (CPL) of the current

Vol. 1 7-21

code segment is 0 (most privileged), the IOPL bits (bits 13 and 12) also are affected. If the I/O privilege level (IOPL) is greater than or equal to the CPL, numerically, the IF flag (bit 9) also is affected.

The POPFD instruction pops a doubleword into the EFLAGS register. This instruction can change the state of the AC bit (bit 18) and the ID bit (bit 21), as well as the bits affected by a POPF instruction. The restrictions for changing the IOPL bits and the IF flag that were given for the POPF instruction also apply to the POPFD instruction.

### 7.3.13.3 Interrupt Flag Instructions

The STI (set interrupt flag) and CLI (clear interrupt flag) instructions allow the interrupt IF flag in the EFLAGS register to be modified directly. The IF flag controls the servicing of hardware-generated interrupts (those received at the processor's INTR pin). If the IF flag is set, the processor services hardware interrupts; if the IF flag is clear, hardware interrupts are masked.

The ability to execute these instructions depends on the operating mode of the processor and the current privilege level (CPL) of the program or task attempting to execute these instructions.

### 7.3.14 Flag Control (RFLAG) Instructions in 64-Bit Mode

In 64-bit mode, the LAHF and SAHF instructions are supported if CPUID.80000001H:ECX.LAHF\_SAHF\_64[0] = 1.

PUSHF and POPF behave the same in 64-bit mode as in non-64-bit mode. PUSHFD always pushes 64-bit RFLAGS onto the stack (with the RF and VM flags read as clear). POPFD always pops a 64-bit value from the top of the stack and loads the lower 32 bits into RFLAGS. It then zero extends the upper bits of RFLAGS.

### 7.3.15 Segment Register Instructions

The processor provides a variety of instructions that address the segment registers of the processor directly. These instructions are only used when an operating system or executive is using the segmented or the real-address mode memory model.

For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that allow:

- Segment-register load and store.
- Far control transfers.
- Software interrupt calls.
- Handling of far pointers.

#### 7.3.15.1 Segment-Register Load and Store Instructions

The MOV instruction (introduced in Section 7.3.1.1, "General Data Movement Instructions") and the PUSH and POP instructions (introduced in Section 7.3.1.4, "Stack Manipulation Instructions") can transfer 16-bit segment selectors to and from segment registers (DS, ES, FS, GS, and SS). The transfers are always made to or from a segment register and a general-purpose register or memory. Transfers between segment registers are not supported.

The POP and MOV instructions cannot place a value in the CS register. Only the far control-transfer versions of the JMP, CALL, and RET instructions (see Section 7.3.15.2, "Far Control Transfer Instructions") affect the CS register directly.

#### 7.3.15.2 Far Control Transfer Instructions

The JMP and CALL instructions (see Section 7.3.8, "Control Transfer Instructions") both accept a far pointer as a destination to transfer program control to a segment other than the segment currently being pointed to by the CS register. When a far call is made with the CALL instruction, the current values of the EIP and CS registers are both pushed on the stack.

The RET instruction (see "Call and return instructions" on page 7-15) can be used to execute a far return. Here, program control is transferred from a code segment that contains a called procedure back to the code segment that

contained the calling procedure. The RET instruction restores the values of the CS and EIP registers for the calling procedure from the stack.

### 7.3.15.3 Software Interrupt Instructions

The software interrupt instructions INT, INTO, and IRET (see Section 7.3.8.4, “Software Interrupt Instructions”) can also call and return from interrupt and exception handler procedures that are located in a code segment other than the current code segment. With these instructions, however, the switching of code segments is handled transparently from the application program.

### 7.3.15.4 Load Far Pointer Instructions

The load far pointer instructions LDS (load far pointer using DS), LES (load far pointer using ES), LFS (load far pointer using FS), LGS (load far pointer using GS), and LSS (load far pointer using SS) load a far pointer from memory into a segment register and a general-purpose general register. The segment selector part of the far pointer is loaded into the selected segment register and the offset is loaded into the selected general-purpose register.

## 7.3.16 Miscellaneous Instructions

The following instructions perform operations that are of interest to applications programmers. For the purpose of this discussion, these instructions are further divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that provide for:

- Address computations.
- Table lookup.
- Processor identification.
- NOP and undefined instruction entry.

### 7.3.16.1 Address Computation Instruction

The LEA (load effective address) instruction computes the effective address in memory (offset within a segment) of a source operand and places it in a general-purpose register. This instruction can interpret any of the processor’s addressing modes and can perform any indexing or scaling that may be needed. It is especially useful for initializing the ESI or EDI registers before the execution of string instructions or for initializing the EBX register before an XLAT instruction.

### 7.3.16.2 Table Lookup Instructions

The XLAT and XLATB (table lookup) instructions replace the contents of the AL register with a byte read from a translation table in memory. The initial value in the AL register is interpreted as an unsigned index into the translation table. This index is added to the contents of the EBX register (which contains the base address of the table) to calculate the address of the table entry. These instructions are used for applications such as converting character codes from one alphabet into another (for example, an ASCII code could be used to look up its EBCDIC equivalent in a table).

### 7.3.16.3 Processor Identification Instruction

The CPUID (processor identification) instruction returns information about the processor on which the instruction is executed.

### 7.3.16.4 No-Operation and Undefined Instructions

The NOP (no operation) instruction increments the EIP register to point at the next instruction, but affects nothing else.

The UD (undefined) instruction generates an invalid opcode exception. Intel reserves the opcode for this instruction for this function. The instruction is provided to allow software to test an invalid opcode exception handler.

### 7.3.17 Random Number Generator Instructions

The instructions for generating random numbers to comply with NIST SP800-90A, SP800-90B, and SP800-90C standards are described in this section.

#### 7.3.17.1 RDRAND

The RDRAND instruction returns a random number. All Intel processors that support the RDRAND instruction indicate the availability of the RDRAND instruction via reporting CPUID.01H:ECX.RDRAND[30] = 1.

RDRAND returns random numbers that are supplied by a cryptographically secure, deterministic random bit generator DRBG. The DRBG is designed to meet the NIST SP 800-90A standard. The DRBG is re-seeded frequently from an on-chip non-deterministic entropy source to guarantee data returned by RDRAND is statistically uniform, non-periodic and non-deterministic.

In order for the hardware design to meet its security goals, the random number generator continuously tests itself and the random data it is generating. Runtime failures in the random number generator circuitry or statistically anomalous data occurring by chance will be detected by the self test hardware and flag the resulting data as being bad. In such extremely rare cases, the RDRAND instruction will return no data instead of bad data.

Under heavy load, with multiple cores executing RDRAND in parallel, it is possible, though unlikely, for the demand of random numbers by software processes/threads to exceed the rate at which the random number generator hardware can supply them. This will lead to the RDRAND instruction returning no data transitorily. The RDRAND instruction indicates the occurrence of this rare situation by clearing the CF flag.

The RDRAND instruction returns with the carry flag set (CF = 1) to indicate valid data is returned. It is recommended that software using the RDRAND instruction to get random numbers retry for a limited number of iterations while RDRAND returns CF = 0 and complete when valid data is returned, indicated with CF = 1. This will deal with transitory underflows. A retry limit should be employed to prevent a hard failure in the RNG (expected to be extremely rare) leading to a busy loop in software.

The intrinsic primitive for RDRAND is defined to address software's need for the common cases (CF = 1) and the rare situations (CF = 0). The intrinsic primitive returns a value that reflects the value of the carry flag returned by the underlying RDRAND instruction. The example below illustrates the recommended usage of an RDRAND intrinsic in a utility function, a loop to fetch a 64 bit random value with a retry count limit of 10. A C implementation might be written as follows:

```
-----
#define SUCCESS 1
#define RETRY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED 0
