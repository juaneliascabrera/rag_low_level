## 2.1 BRIEF HISTORY OF INTEL® 64 AND IA-32 ARCHITECTURES

The following sections provide a summary of the major technical evolutions from IA-32 to Intel 64 architecture: starting from the Intel 8086 processor to the latest Intel® Core® 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad and Intel Xeon processor 5300 and 7300 series. Object code created for processors released as early as 1978 still executes on the latest processors in the Intel 64 and IA-32 architecture families.

### 2.1.1 16-Bit Processors and Segmentation (1978)

The IA-32 architecture family was preceded by 16-bit processors, the 8086 and 8088. The 8086 has 16-bit registers and a 16-bit external data bus, with 20-bit addressing giving a 1-MByte address space. The 8088 is similar to the 8086 except it has an 8-bit external data bus.

The 8086/8088 introduced segmentation to the IA-32 architecture. With segmentation, a 16-bit segment register contains a pointer to a memory segment of up to 64 KBytes. Using four segment registers at a time, 8086/8088 processors are able to address up to 256 KBytes without switching between segments. The 20-bit addresses that can be formed using a segment register and an additional 16-bit pointer provide a total address range of 1 MByte.

### 2.1.2 The Intel® 286 Processor (1982)

The Intel 286 processor introduced protected mode operation into the IA-32 architecture. Protected mode uses the segment register content as selectors or pointers into descriptor tables. Descriptors provide 24-bit base addresses with a physical memory size of up to 16 MBytes, support for virtual memory management on a segment swapping basis, and a number of protection mechanisms. These mechanisms include:

- Segment limit checking.
- Read-only and execute-only segment options.
- Four privilege levels.

### 2.1.3 The Intel386™ Processor (1985)

The Intel386 processor was the first 32-bit processor in the IA-32 architecture family. It introduced 32-bit registers for use both to hold operands and for addressing. The lower half of each 32-bit Intel386 register retains the properties of the 16-bit registers of earlier generations, permitting backward compatibility. The processor also provides a virtual-8086 mode that allows for even greater efficiency when executing programs created for 8086/8088 processors.

In addition, the Intel386 processor has support for:

- A 32-bit address bus that supports up to 4-GBytes of physical memory.
- A segmented-memory model and a flat memory model.
- Paging, with a fixed 4-KByte page size providing a method for virtual memory management.
- Support for parallel stages.

### 2.1.4 The Intel486™ Processor (1989)

The Intel486™ processor added more parallel execution capability by expanding the Intel386 processor's instruction decode and execution units into five pipelined stages. Each stage operates in parallel with the others on up to five instructions in different stages of execution.

In addition, the processor added:

- An 8-KByte on-chip first-level cache that increased the percent of instructions that could execute at the scalar rate of one per clock.
- An integrated x87 FPU.
- Power saving and system management capabilities.

### 2.1.5 The Intel® Pentium® Processor (1993)

The introduction of the Intel Pentium processor added a second execution pipeline to achieve superscalar performance (two pipelines, known as u and v, together can execute two instructions per clock). The on-chip first-level cache doubled, with 8 KBytes devoted to code and another 8 KBytes devoted to data. The data cache uses the MESI protocol to support more efficient write-back cache in addition to the write-through cache previously used by the Intel486 processor. Branch prediction with an on-chip branch table was added to increase performance in looping constructs.

In addition, the processor added:

- Extensions to make the virtual-8086 mode more efficient and allow for 4-MByte as well as 4-KByte pages.
- Internal data paths of 128 and 256 bits add speed to internal data transfers.
- Burstable external data bus was increased to 64 bits.
- An APIC to support systems with multiple processors.
- A dual processor mode to support glueless two processor systems.

A subsequent stepping of the Pentium family introduced Intel MMX technology (the Pentium Processor with MMX technology). Intel MMX technology uses the single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) execution model to perform parallel computations on packed integer data contained in 64-bit registers.

See Section 2.2.7, “SIMD Instructions.”

### 2.1.6 The P6 Family of Processors (1995–1999)

The P6 family of processors was based on a superscalar microarchitecture that set new performance standards; see also Section 2.2.1, “P6 Family Microarchitecture.” One of the goals in the design of the P6 family microarchitecture was to exceed the performance of the Pentium processor significantly while using the same 0.6-micrometer, four-layer, metal BICMOS manufacturing process. Members of this family include the following:

- The **Intel Pentium Pro processor** is three-way superscalar. Using parallel processing techniques, the processor is able on average to decode, dispatch, and complete execution of (retire) three instructions per clock cycle. The Pentium Pro introduced the dynamic execution (micro-data flow analysis, out-of-order execution, superior branch prediction, and speculative execution) in a superscalar implementation. The processor was further enhanced by its caches. It has the same two on-chip 8-KByte 1st-Level caches as the Pentium processor and an additional 256-KByte Level 2 cache in the same package as the processor.
- The **Intel Pentium II processor** added Intel MMX technology to the P6 family processors along with new packaging and several hardware enhancements. The processor core is packaged in the single edge contact cartridge (SECC). The Level 1 data and instruction caches were enlarged to 16 KBytes each, and Level 2 cache sizes of 256 KBytes, 512 KBytes, and 1 MBytes are supported. A half-frequency backside bus connects the Level 2 cache to the processor. Multiple low-power states such as AutoHALT, Stop-Grant, Sleep, and Deep Sleep are supported to conserve power when idling.
- The **Pentium II Xeon processor** combined the premium characteristics of previous generations of Intel processors. This includes: 4-way, 8-way (and up) scalability and a 2 MBytes 2nd-Level cache running on a full-frequency backside bus.
- The **Intel Celeron processor** family focused on the value PC market segment. Its introduction offers an integrated 128 KBytes of Level 2 cache and a plastic pin grid array (P.P.G.A.) form factor to lower system design cost.
- The **Intel Pentium III processor** introduced the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) to the IA-32 architecture. SSE extensions expand the SIMD execution model introduced with the Intel MMX technology by providing a

new set of 128-bit registers and the ability to perform SIMD operations on packed single precision floating-point values. See Section 2.2.7, “SIMD Instructions.”

- The **Pentium III Xeon processor** extended the performance levels of the IA-32 processors with the enhancement of a full-speed, on-die, and Advanced Transfer Cache.

## 2.2 MORE ON SPECIFIC ADVANCES

The following sections provide more information on major innovations.

### 2.2.1 P6 Family Microarchitecture

The Pentium Pro processor introduced a new microarchitecture commonly referred to as P6 processor microarchitecture. The P6 processor microarchitecture was later enhanced with an on-die, Level 2 cache, called Advanced Transfer Cache.

The microarchitecture is a three-way superscalar, pipelined architecture. Three-way superscalar means that by using parallel processing techniques, the processor is able on average to decode, dispatch, and complete execution of (retire) three instructions per clock cycle. To handle this level of instruction throughput, the P6 processor family uses a decoupled, 12-stage superpipeline that supports out-of-order instruction execution.

Figure 2-1 shows a conceptual view of the P6 processor microarchitecture pipeline with the Advanced Transfer Cache enhancement.

![Figure 2-1: The P6 Processor Microarchitecture with Advanced Transfer Cache Enhancement. This block diagram illustrates the internal components and data flow of the P6 processor. At the top, the 'System Bus' connects to a 'Bus Unit'. The 'Bus Unit' is linked to a '2nd Level Cache On-die, 8-way'. This cache is connected to a '1st Level Cache 4-way, low latency'. The '1st Level Cache' feeds into the 'Execution Out-of-Order Core', which then leads to 'Retirement'. A 'Branch History Update' path returns from retirement to the core. The 'Front End' contains 'Fetch/Decode' and 'Execution Instruction Cache Microcode ROM'. 'Fetch/Decode' is connected to the '2nd Level Cache' and the 'Execution Instruction Cache'. 'BTs/Branch Prediction' is connected to 'Fetch/Decode' and the 'Execution Instruction Cache'. Solid lines indicate frequently used paths, while dashed lines indicate less frequently used paths.

**Figure 2-1. The P6 Processor Microarchitecture with Advanced Transfer Cache Enhancement**

To ensure a steady supply of instructions and data for the instruction execution pipeline, the P6 processor microarchitecture incorporates two cache levels. The Level 1 cache provides an 8-KByte instruction cache and an 8-KByte data cache, both closely coupled to the pipeline. The Level 2 cache provides 256-KByte, 512-KByte, or 1-MByte static RAM that is coupled to the core processor through a full clock-speed 64-bit cache bus.

The centerpiece of the P6 processor microarchitecture is an out-of-order execution mechanism called dynamic execution. Dynamic execution incorporates three data-processing concepts:

- **Deep branch prediction** allows the processor to decode instructions beyond branches to keep the instruction pipeline full. The P6 processor family implements highly optimized branch prediction algorithms to predict the direction of the instruction.
- **Dynamic data flow analysis** requires real-time analysis of the flow of data through the processor to determine dependencies and to detect opportunities for out-of-order instruction execution. The out-of-order execution core can monitor many instructions and execute these instructions in the order that best optimizes the use of the processor's multiple execution units, while maintaining the data integrity.
- **Speculative execution** refers to the processor's ability to execute instructions that lie beyond a conditional branch that has not yet been resolved, and ultimately to commit the results in the order of the original instruction stream. To make speculative execution possible, the P6 processor microarchitecture decouples the dispatch and execution of instructions from the commitment of results. The processor's out-of-order execution core uses data-flow analysis to execute all available instructions in the instruction pool and store the results in temporary registers. The retirement unit then linearly searches the instruction pool for completed instructions that no longer have data dependencies with other instructions or unresolved branch predictions. When completed instructions are found, the retirement unit commits the results of these instructions to memory and/or the IA-32 registers (the processor's eight general-purpose registers and eight x87 FPU data registers) in the order they were originally issued and retires the instructions from the instruction pool.

### 2.2.2.1 The Front End Pipeline

The front end supplies instructions in program order to the out-of-order execution core. It performs a number of functions:

- Prefetches instructions that are likely to be executed.
- Fetches instructions that have not already been prefetched.
- Decodes instructions into micro-operations.
- Generates microcode for complex instructions and special-purpose code.
- Delivers decoded instructions from the execution trace cache.
- Predicts branches using highly advanced algorithm.

The pipeline is designed to address common problems in high-speed, pipelined microprocessors. Two of these problems contribute to major sources of delays:

- Time to decode instructions fetched from the target.

- Wasted decode bandwidth due to branches or branch target in the middle of cache lines.

The operation of the pipeline's trace cache addresses these issues. Instructions are constantly being fetched and decoded by the translation engine (part of the fetch/decode logic) and built into sequences of micro-ops called traces. At any time, multiple traces (representing prefetched branches) are being stored in the trace cache. The trace cache is searched for the instruction that follows the active branch. If the instruction also appears as the first instruction in a pre-fetched branch, the fetch and decode of instructions from the memory hierarchy ceases and the pre-fetched branch becomes the new source of instructions (see Figure 2-2).

The trace cache and the translation engine have cooperating branch prediction hardware. Branch targets are predicted based on their linear addresses using branch target buffers (BTBs) and fetched as soon as possible.

### 2.2.2.2 Out-Of-Order Execution Core

The out-of-order execution core's ability to execute instructions out of order is a key factor in enabling parallelism. This feature enables the processor to reorder instructions so that if one micro-op is delayed, other micro-ops may proceed around it. The processor employs several buffers to smooth the flow of micro-ops.

The core is designed to facilitate parallel execution. It can dispatch up to six micro-ops per cycle (this exceeds trace cache and retirement micro-op bandwidth). Most pipelines can start executing a new micro-op every cycle, so several instructions can be in flight at a time for each pipeline. A number of arithmetic logical unit (ALU) instructions can start at two per cycle; many floating-point instructions can start once every two cycles.

### 2.2.2.3 Retirement Unit

The retirement unit receives the results of the executed micro-ops from the out-of-order execution core and processes the results so that the architectural state updates according to the original program order.

When a micro-op completes and writes its result, it is retired. Up to three micro-ops may be retired per cycle. The Reorder Buffer (ROB) is the unit in the processor which buffers completed micro-ops, updates the architectural state in order, and manages the ordering of exceptions. The retirement section also keeps track of branches and sends updated branch target information to the BTB. The BTB then purges pre-fetched traces that are no longer needed.

## 2.2.7 SIMD Instructions

Beginning with the Pentium II and Pentium with Intel MMX technology processor families, six extensions have been introduced into the Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures to perform single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. These extensions include the MMX technology, SSE extensions, SSE2 extensions, SSE3 extensions, Supplemental Streaming SIMD Extensions 3, and SSE4. Each of these extensions provides a group of instructions that perform SIMD operations on packed integer and/or packed floating-point data elements.

SIMD integer operations can use the 64-bit MMX or the 128-bit XMM registers. SIMD floating-point operations use 128-bit XMM registers. Figure 2-4 shows a summary of the various SIMD extensions (MMX technology, Intel SSE, Intel SSE2, Intel SSE3, SSSE3, and Intel SSE4), the data types they operate on, and how the data types are packed into MMX and XMM registers.

The Intel MMX technology was introduced in the Pentium II and Pentium with MMX technology processor families. MMX instructions perform SIMD operations on packed byte, word, or doubleword integers located in MMX registers. These instructions are useful in applications that operate on integer arrays and streams of integer data that lend themselves to SIMD processing.

Intel SSE was introduced in the Pentium III processor family. Intel SSE instructions operate on packed single precision floating-point values contained in XMM registers and on packed integers contained in MMX registers. Several Intel SSE instructions provide state management, cache control, and memory ordering operations. Other Intel SSE instructions are targeted at applications that operate on arrays of single precision floating-point data elements (3-D geometry, 3-D rendering, and video encoding and decoding applications).

Intel SSE2 was introduced in the Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors. Intel SSE2 instructions operate on packed double precision floating-point values contained in XMM registers and on packed integers contained in MMX and XMM registers. Intel SSE2 integer instructions extend IA-32 SIMD operations by adding new 128-bit SIMD integer operations and by expanding existing 64-bit SIMD integer operations to 128-bit XMM capability. Intel SSE2 instructions also provide new cache control and memory ordering operations.

Intel SSE3 was introduced with the Pentium 4 processor supporting Hyper-Threading Technology (built on 90 nm process technology). Intel SSE3 offers 13 instructions that accelerate performance of Streaming SIMD Extensions technology, Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 technology, and x87-FP math capabilities.

SSSE3 was introduced with the Intel Xeon processor 5100 series and Intel Core 2 processor family. SSSE3 offer 32 instructions to accelerate processing of SIMD integer data.

Intel SSE4 offers 54 instructions. 47 of them are referred to as Intel SSE4.1 instructions. Intel SSE4.1 was introduced with the Intel Xeon processor 5400 series and Intel Core 2 Extreme processor QX9650. The other seven Intel SSE4 instructions are referred to as Intel SSE4.2 instructions.

Intel AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ introduced seven new instructions. Six of them are primitives for accelerating algorithms based on AES encryption/decryption standard, and are referred to as Intel AES-NI.

The PCLMULQDQ instruction accelerates general-purpose block encryption, which can perform carry-less multiplication for two binary numbers up to 64-bit wide.

Intel 64 architecture allows four generations of 128-bit SIMD extensions to access up to 16 XMM registers. IA-32 architecture provides eight XMM registers.

Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions offers comprehensive architectural enhancements over previous generations of Streaming SIMD Extensions. Intel AVX introduces the following architectural enhancements:

- Support for 256-bit wide vectors and SIMD register set.
- 256-bit floating-point instruction set enhancement with up to 2X performance gain relative to 128-bit Streaming SIMD extensions.
- Instruction syntax support for generalized three-operand syntax to improve instruction programming flexibility and efficient encoding of new instruction extensions.
- Enhancement of legacy 128-bit SIMD instruction extensions to support three operand syntax and to simplify compiler vectorization of high-level language expressions.
- Support flexible deployment of 256-bit AVX code, 128-bit AVX code, legacy 128-bit code and scalar code.

In addition to performance considerations, programmers should also be cognizant of the implications of VEX-encoded AVX instructions with the expectations of system software components that manage the processor state components enabled by XCR0.

## 2.2.8 Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology

Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel HT Technology) was developed to improve the performance of IA-32 processors when executing multi-threaded operating system and application code or single-threaded applications under multi-tasking environments. The technology enables a single physical processor to execute two or more separate code streams (threads) concurrently using shared execution resources.

Intel HT Technology is one form of hardware multi-threading capability in IA-32 processor families. It differs from multi-processor capability using separate physically distinct packages with each physical processor package mated with a physical socket. Intel HT Technology provides hardware multi-threading capability with a single physical package by using shared execution resources in a processor core.

Architecturally, an IA-32 processor that supports Intel HT Technology consists of two or more logical processors, each of which has its own IA-32 architectural state. Each logical processor consists of a full set of IA-32 data registers, segment registers, control registers, debug registers, and most of the MSRs. Each also has its own advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC).

Figure 2-5 shows a comparison of a processor that supports Intel HT Technology (implemented with two logical processors) and a traditional dual processor system.

![Diagram comparing an IA-32 Processor Supporting Hyper-Threading Technology with a Traditional Multiple Processor (MP) System.](fc02903382cebe6fc11e4c0d74b5313f_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the difference between a single processor with hyper-threading and a traditional multi-processor system. On the left, a single 'IA-32 processor' block contains a 'Processor Core' and two 'AS' (Architectural State) boxes, with a label below stating 'Two logical processors that share a single core'. On the right, a 'Traditional Multiple Processor (MP) System' shows three separate 'IA-32 processor' blocks, each with its own 'Processor Core' and 'AS' box, with a label below stating 'Each processor is a separate physical package'. A horizontal double-headed arrow spans the width of the diagram, with the text 'AS = IA-32 Architectural State' centered below it. The identifier 'OM16522' is located in the bottom right corner of the diagram area.

Diagram comparing an IA-32 Processor Supporting Hyper-Threading Technology with a Traditional Multiple Processor (MP) System.

**Figure 2-5. Comparison of an IA-32 Processor Supporting Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology and a Traditional Dual Processor System**

Unlike a traditional MP system configuration that uses two or more separate physical IA-32 processors, the logical processors in an IA-32 processor supporting Intel HT Technology share the core resources of the physical processor. This includes the execution engine and the system bus interface. After power up and initialization, each logical processor can be independently directed to execute a specified thread, interrupted, or halted.

Intel HT Technology leverages the process and thread-level parallelism found in contemporary operating systems and high-performance applications by providing two or more logical processors on a single chip. This configuration allows two or more threads<sup>1</sup> to be executed simultaneously on each a physical processor. Each logical processor executes instructions from an application thread using the resources in the processor core. The core executes these threads concurrently, using out-of-order instruction scheduling to maximize the use of execution units during each clock cycle.

### 2.2.8.1 Some Implementation Notes

All Intel HT Technology configurations require:

- A processor that supports Intel HT Technology.
- A chipset and BIOS that utilize the technology.
- Operating system optimizations.

See [http://www.intel.com/products/ht/hyperthreading\\_more.htm](http://www.intel.com/products/ht/hyperthreading_more.htm) for information.

At the firmware (BIOS) level, the basic procedures to initialize the logical processors in a processor supporting Intel HT Technology are the same as those for a traditional DP or MP platform. The mechanisms that are described in the Multiprocessor Specification, Version 1.4, to power-up and initialize physical processors in an MP system also apply to logical processors in a processor that supports Intel HT Technology.

An operating system designed to run on a traditional DP or MP platform may use CPUID to determine the presence of hardware multi-threading support feature and the number of logical processors they provide.

Although existing operating system and application code should run correctly on a processor that supports Intel HT Technology, some code modifications are recommended to get the optimum benefit. These modifications are discussed in Chapter 7, "Multiple-Processor Management," Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3A.

## 2.2.9 Multi-Core Technology

Multi-core technology is another form of hardware multi-threading capability in IA-32 processor families. Multi-core technology enhances hardware multi-threading capability by providing two or more execution cores in a physical package.

The Intel Pentium processor Extreme Edition is the first member in the IA-32 processor family to introduce multi-core technology. The processor provides hardware multi-threading support with both two processor cores and Intel Hyper-Threading Technology. This means that the Intel Pentium processor Extreme Edition provides four logical processors in a physical package (two logical processors for each processor core). The Dual-Core Intel Xeon processor features multi-core, Intel Hyper-Threading Technology and supports multi-processor platforms.

The Intel Pentium D processor also features multi-core technology. This processor provides hardware multi-threading support with two processor cores but does not offer Intel Hyper-Threading Technology. This means that the Intel Pentium D processor provides two logical processors in a physical package, with each logical processor owning the complete execution resources of a processor core.

The Intel Core 2 processor family, Intel Xeon processor 3000 series, Intel Xeon processor 5100 series, and Intel Core Duo processor offer power-efficient multi-core technology. The processor contains two cores that share a smart second level cache. The Level 2 cache enables efficient data sharing between two cores to reduce memory traffic to the system bus.

![Diagram showing the internal architecture of three Intel dual-core processors: Intel Core Duo, Intel Core 2 Duo, and Intel Pentium dual-core (top left); Pentium D (top right); and Pentium Processor Extreme Edition (bottom). Each processor is connected to a System Bus via a Bus Interface. The Core Duo and Core 2 Duo share a Second Level Cache. The Pentium D and Pentium Processor Extreme Edition have separate caches for each core.](7722d62e33dcc894cc8555e9474c5606_img.jpg)

The diagram illustrates the internal architecture of three Intel dual-core processors, each connected to a System Bus via a Bus Interface.

- Intel Core Duo Processor, Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, Intel Pentium dual-core Processor:** These processors share a common architecture. They consist of two cores, each with its own Architectural State, Execution Engine, and Local APIC. A shared Second Level Cache is located below the cores, connected to the System Bus via a Bus Interface.
- Pentium D Processor:** This processor consists of two cores, each with its own Architectural State, Execution Engine, and Local APIC. Each core has its own Bus Interface connected to the System Bus.

## 2.2.10 Intel® 64 Architecture

Intel 64 architecture increases the linear address space for software to 64 bits and supports physical address space up to 52 bits. The technology also introduces a new operating mode referred to as IA-32e mode.

IA-32e mode operates in one of two sub-modes: (1) compatibility mode enables a 64-bit operating system to run most legacy 32-bit software unmodified, (2) 64-bit mode enables a 64-bit operating system to run applications written to access 64-bit address space.

In the 64-bit mode, applications may access:

- 64-bit flat linear addressing.
- 8 additional general-purpose registers (GPRs).
- 8 additional registers for streaming SIMD extensions (Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3, and SSSE3).
- 64-bit-wide GPRs and instruction pointers.
- Uniform byte-register addressing.
- Fast interrupt-prioritization mechanism.
- A new instruction-pointer relative-addressing mode.

An Intel 64 architecture processor supports existing IA-32 software because it is able to run all non-64-bit legacy modes supported by IA-32 architecture. Most existing IA-32 applications also run in compatibility mode.

## 2.2.11 Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT)

Intel® Virtualization Technology for Intel 64 and IA-32 architectures provide extensions that support virtualization. The extensions are referred to as Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX). An Intel 64 or IA-32 platform with VMX can function as multiple virtual systems (or virtual machines). Each virtual machine can run operating systems and applications in separate partitions.

VMX also provides programming interface for a new layer of system software (called the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)) used to manage the operation of virtual machines. Information on VMX and on the programming of VMMs is in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3C.

Intel Core i7 processor provides the following enhancements to Intel Virtualization Technology:

- Virtual processor ID (VPID) to reduce the cost of VMM managing transitions.
- Extended page table (EPT) to reduce the number of transitions for VMM to manage memory virtualization.
- Reduced latency of VM transitions.

## 2.3 INTEL® 64 AND IA-32 PROCESSOR GENERATIONS

In the mid-1960s, Intel co-founder and Chairman Emeritus Gordon Moore had this observation: "... the number of transistors that would be incorporated on a silicon die would double every 18 months for the next several years." Over the past three and half decades, this prediction known as "Moore's Law" has continued to hold true.

The computing power and the complexity (or roughly, the number of transistors per processor) of Intel architecture processors has grown in close relation to Moore's law. By taking advantage of new process technology and new microarchitecture designs, each new generation of IA-32 processors has demonstrated frequency-scaling headroom and new performance levels over the previous generation processors.

The key features of the Intel Pentium 4 processor, Intel Xeon processor, Intel Xeon processor MP, Pentium III processor, and Pentium III Xeon processor with advanced transfer cache are shown in Table 2-1. Older generation IA-32 processors, which do not employ on-die Level 2 cache, are shown in Table 2-2.

**NOTES:**

1. The register size and external data bus size are given in bits. Note also that each 32-bit general-purpose (GP) registers can be addressed as an 8- or a 16-bit data registers in all of the processors.
2. Internal data paths are 2 to 4 times wider than the external data bus for each processor.

This chapter describes the basic execution environment of an Intel 64 or IA-32 processor as seen by assembly-language programmers. It describes how the processor executes instructions and how it stores and manipulates data. The execution environment described here includes memory (the address space), general-purpose data registers, segment registers, the flag register, and the instruction pointer register.
